AB  -  Compared to disorders in reading, spelling, and written expression, mathematics disorders have received little attention by learning disabilities specialists. However, in recent years, Cawley and his associates at the University of Connecticut have made significant contributions in this area through their research and development efforts with learning disabled populations. This represents the first in a series of three articles which will focus upon mathematics and learning disabled students. Specifically, this article presents a model for mathematics programming for handicapped youth that considers both the characteristics of the learner and the appropriate representation of mathematics. The second article will present an interpretive review of the literature and the characteristics of learning disabled youth and mathematics. The final article will focus on problem solving and the application of mathematical skills and concepts to “real-life” situations.

TI  - The Comparative Validity of the California State University and Colleges English Placement Test (CSUC-EPT) in the Prediction of Fall Semester Grade Point Average and English Course Grades of First-Semester Entering Freshmen

AB  -  The California State University and Colleges English Placement Test (CSUC-EPT) was designed to provide information about the performance levels in both reading and writing skills of newly admitted students (mostly freshmen) to any one of the campuses of the California State University and Colleges system (beginning with the Fall 1977 semester or quarter) (Educational Testing Service, 1977a, b). For a total sample of several hundred entering freshmen at one campus who had completed the CSUC-EPT and who had elected to take the general English Composition course (English 155) during the first semester as well as for nearly equal size subsamples of males and females, the major purpose of the investigation was to determine the comparative validity of the CSUC-EPT and of other measures in the prediction of each of two specific criterion variables—1977 Fall Semester Grade Point Average (GPA) and English 155 Grades.  For the total sample as well as for subsamples of females and males, intercorrelations among 11 predictor variables and the two identified criterion measures were found, and several multiple regression analyses were carried out to ascertain which particular combinations of predictor variables were the most valid indicators of success on each criterion measure.  The evidence provided by the findings led to these conclusions: (1) high school GPA is the most valid predictor of college GPA for males and females; (2) the CSUC-EPT offers slightly greater promise than does high school GPA in predicting grades in a basic English composition course; (3) future success of females in this course can be forecast with a higher degree of validity than can that of males; and (4) among several possible composites of predictor variables an optimally weighted combination of high school GPA and performance level on the CSUC-EPT typically provides the most accurate prediction of success on either criterion measure.

AB  -  Changes in academic self-concept, as measured by the Student's Perception of Ability Scale, were studied in elementary special education students receiving full-time remedial placement. Pre-post data were collected over a 12-month period on 50 severely learning disabled, 18 educable mentally handicapped, and 83 reg-' ular class children. The results revealed that full-time placement was accompanied by statistically significant increases in academic self-concept, especially in the areas of reading/ spelling and confidence. The discussion deals with possible causes for these changes, e.g., achievement gains and peer reference-group comparisons. Implications of the findings in terms of assessing changes in academic self-concept as a function of remedial placement are discussed.

AB  -  Identification and placement practices in the area of mental retardation have been widely discussed; they are considered by many to be problemmatic. Little research has been completed with regard to exit criteria for children who should be reassigned to a regular classroom. The focus of this study was exit criteria. Typical assessment information as well as measures of achievement efficiency were used to predict program placement for a group of educable mentally retarded youngsters. Actual class placement was correctly predicted for 84% of the development sample. The results are discussed with regard to implications for assessment practices for the mentally retarded.

AB  -  Data from a large racially representative sample of school children show that the trend toward placing minority students into special education classes in disproportionate numbers has been complicated by the introduction of the learning-disability (LD) category. While the proportion of blacks in classes for the mentally retarded has decreased with the recent emphasis on protection in evaluation, the increased proportion of blacks in LD classes has been so great that the result has been an increasingly disproportionate number of blacks in special education classes overall. This is in spite of national efforts to the contrary.

AB  -  The purpose of this study was to investigate differences between physically separated second-grade children and their classmates with regard to social position, attitude toward school, and self-concept. Additionally, data were gathered to determine whether there exists a preponderance of children of one sex, racial group, age, intelligence level, or achievement level, who are more frequently separated from other children. Teacher ratings of these children's overt behavior were also examined. No significant differences were found concerning self-concept, attitude toward school, achievement level, and age. Significant differences were found for sex, racial minority status, social position, intelligence level, and overt behavior. The results supported the assumption that the social positions of physically separated children are different from those of the non-physically separated children. The study was interpreted as having implications for teachers, counselors, and school administrators who may overlook the effect of physically separating problem children within the classroom.

AB  -  This study examined the standardized reading test scores, family socioeconomic status (SES), and teacher-assigned reading groups of pupils in 37 midelementary classrooms from four school districts. The analysis assessed: (1) the relative relationship of SES and reading test measurements with assignments to reading groups; (2) the relative degree of socioeconomic segregation resulting from grouping based on teacher judgments and reading tests; (3) the relationship of teachers’ own SES background to the extent of socioeconomic segregation in their classrooms. Little support was found for the conjecture that either pupil or teacher social class plays a major role in reading grouping in elementary schools.

But they are often higher than WISC-R scores and increasingly verbally weighted. A skilled teacher's classroom observation is as valid an indicator of need for in-depth assessment as screening tests.

The results indicated that team placement decisions and formalized IEPs were' somewhat less effective than unilateral placement and informal programming procedures. The factors of sex and type (normal, EMR, LD/BD) were the primary determinants of social adjustment and acceptance.

AB  -  Fifty primary research studies of special versus regular class placement were selected for use in a meta-analysis. Each study provided a measure of Effect Size (ES), defined as the posttreatment difference between special and regular placement means expressed in standard deviation units. ES was used as a dependent variable in order to assess the effects of independent variables such as placement; type of outcome measure; internal validity; and other educational, personological, and methodological variables. Special classes were found to be significantly inferior to regular class placement for students with below average IQs, and significantly superior to regular classes for behaviorally disordered, emotionally disturbed, and learning-disabled children. Other independent variables bore little or no relationship to ES.

AB  -  A follow-up study was conducted to ascertain if the rate of reading gain made during part-time placement in a resource room would be maintained following a year of full-time attendance in the regular classes. The Wide Range Achievement Test (WRA T) was administered to 62 learning disabled children. Statistical analyses were computed for children grouped by duration of intervention and chronological age and were compared among the three testing phases: pretest, posttest, and follow-up. It was found that the resource room intervention is effective for increasing reading rates of learning disabled children but that the increased rates do not appear to be maintained in the regular classrooms. The group with the shortest stay in the resource room made significantly greater rate gains during treatment and continued during follow-up to learn at a higher rate. Conversely there were no significant differences between the chronological age groups. However, the difference between the testing phases was statistically significant. The author suggested alternative strategies to sustain the increased rates of reading achievement for children returning full time to the regular classrooms.

AB  -  Attitudes and personal characteristics of regular class teachers were examined in 32 regular class teachers. Of these, 16 had had a 7- or 8-year-old child transferred from their class to a special class (SC teachers), while the remainder, who had children of comparable age and ability in their classes, did not refer such children to special class placement (NR teachers). The NR teachers were more in favor of mainstream provisions for low-ability children; they reported a higher proportion of low achievers in their classes; and a higher proportion of them were married. The results are discussed in terms of the probable influence of teacher attitudes and characteristics on special class placement decisions and on mainstreaming program effectiveness.

AB  - This study was an attempt to determine if teachers discriminate against female learners of mathematics. More than 1000 secondary mathematics teachers, selected at random within New York State, were asked to grade four geometry proofs. Only two characteristics of the student presumed to have written the examination were conveyed to each of the teacher-graders. Student sex and ability level (above average, average, and below average) constituted the independent variables in a 2 × 3 factorial design. A seventh experimental condition, in which no biographical information was given, was included as a control. An analysis of variance of the reponses yielded no statistically significant F ratios for either of the two main effects or the interaction effect. A separate analysis of a small group of late responses similarly revealed no statistically significant differences in mean scores.

AB  -  Syracuse University's Psychoeducational Teaching Laboratory attempted to evaluate how well it was transmitting the principles of multidimensional and nonbiased assessment practices to its students. School psychology and special education graduate students were asked to make program placement decisions for a child when given data about IQ, adaptive behavior higher than IQ, and academic achievement. Results indicated that the school psychology and special education programs were equally successful in training students to seek least restrictive school placements. Their decisions reflected a greater degree of integration with nonhandicapped students than might be expected from either the child's IQ or adaptive-behavior data alone. However, no matter what the order of presentation of IQ and adaptive-behavior data, IQ had a powerful paralyzing effect on further flexibility in problem solving. For these students, the mainstreaming ideology had taken hold, but the IQ information had not been demystified. If these findings are supported in replications, definite implications arise regarding the manner of presenting IQ information when making placement decisions. It has been known for a long time that IQ is not highly related to our educational system's goal of post-school adult adjustment. Therefore the recent development of adaptive-behavior measures, although imperfect in conceptualization and construction, is viewed positively. Their impact upon school placement and programming decisions, relative to other measures, will depend on future reliability and validity research.

The subjects included: (a) 20 LD students enrolled in secondary regular classes, (b) 20 LD students in vocational training classes, and (c) 20 LD students integrated into regular secondary classes and receiving additional assistance in learning resource centers. Results indicate that subjects in the vocational training class were superior to the other two groups in social maturity and career attitudes. Additionally, significant differences in social maturity and career attitudes were found among the three learning disabled groups.

AB  -  This research provides additional data relative to the efficacy of self-contained delivery systems for learning disabled children. The effect of one- or two-year special class placement on academic achievement and intellectual functioning was investigated. The number of years in a self-contained class significantly affected arithmetic achievement, F (1.24) = 4.50. p < .05. Significant differences in regression in IQ scores of both groups occurred. These results suggest that additional efficacy research should be conducted prior to formulation of conclusions relative to the use of self-contained classes for LD youngsters. The concept of determining placement alternatives on an individual basis continues to be advocated.

AB  -  Little research has been done on direct observation of retarded children in ongoing classroom situations, despite the fact that it can provide data on social or academic characteristics which are often quite different from those obtained by indirect measures such as teacher ratings or psychometrics. In the present study, over 900 children were observed in different classroom settings with regard to verbal interaction, attending, nonattending, and disruptive behavior. These were further broken into 3 conditions in which either peers or teachers were involved or where no observable response to the behavior was noticed. While total on-task behavior distinguished institutionalized children from children in community schools and special classes, it did not differentiate retarded children in community-based classrooms from one another. While some unexpected patterns of behavior emerged in each group, these generally tended to disappear when within-group classroom differences were taken into account. Some developmental trends were also observed. Surprisingly, overall levels of on-task behavior compared favorably with those found in previous observation studies of normal children.

AB  -  The Test of Standard Written English (TSWE) was developed to assess the ability of college students to use English. Most of the research has validated the use of the TSWE with freshman level students. The one study with older junior and master's degree level students was replicated with the one-year cumulative grade point average serving as the criterion variable. Confirmed was the finding that TSWE scores, resulting placement, and subsequent success in an English course (if required) was predictive of the academic success of older upper-division and master's level students.

AB  -  This study assessed the predictive validity and classification accuracy of the Kindergarten Teacher Rating Scale (KTRS). The KTRS was a significant predictor of first grade reading achievement for three school districts. The KTRS also explained a significantly greater proportion of the variance in first grade reading scores than did the reading readiness tests used in the districts studied. Finally the percentages of correct classification for the KTRS were greater than the percentages of correct classification for the reading readiness tests.

AB  -  Thirty-four tests measuring verbal ability, academic achievement, reading skills, attitudes, visual perception, spelling, and word decoding skills were compared for their correlational strengths with grade in a required freshman course in composition. In several modes of analysis scores from the English subtest of the ACT Assessment yielded the strongest and most pervasive relationship to composition grades. Several other language tests showed varying power to discriminate between groups of students with high, middle, or low grades in the composition course, but a strong correlation between scores measuring word-level skills and grade in freshman course in composition suggests their unique potential in test batteries designed for the differential placement of students into English composition courses.

AB  -  The Descriptive Tests of Mathematics Skills (DTMS) was designed for a wide range of uses in mathematics courses at the lower division level. Two tests of the battery, Elementary Algebra Skills and Intermediate Algebra Skills, were employed for placement purposes with older junior level students. Students not having the requisite skills for calculus and for statistics were required to pass an algebra course before enrolling in the advanced mathematics course. For the calculus course and for the statistics course, the average performance level of the students who had passed the DTMS was significantly higher than that observed for the students who had successfully remediated their identified weakness. Regarding the remediation, the grades in the algebra course were significantly correlated with (a) grades earned in the calculus course and (b) grades earned in the statistics course. Thus, the DTMS was found to be an effective placement instrument for older upper-division students in a curriculum demanding advanced level mathematics courses.

AB  -  At an upper division university, students entering the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program were graduated from Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) programs or graduated from hospital-based (diploma) programs. The admission criteria for the two groups of students were almost identical. The exception was that the diploma nurses were required to pass three ACT Proficiency Examination Program (PEP) tests with a standard score of 45 or more. The cumulative grade point averages (CGPAs) of the two groups of students at the upper division institution were compared. The CGPA of the diploma nurses was significantly higher than that of their ADN peers. Thus, the PEP credit-by-examination testing model was found to be an effective alternative to determine the advanced standing of students graduated from hospital-based nursing programs who were entering a BSN program at an upper division university.

The results of the survey indicated that many parents are not actively involved in making educational decisions regarding their child. Furthermore, many parents are uncertain about how their child is functioning in an educational setting. These findings are discussed as they relate to the need for (a) greater parent involvement, and (b) attitude changes on the part of school personnel toward parents' role in the educational process.

AB  -  Three hypotheses adduced from social-comparison theory were tested by assessing the self-concepts of several children groups. Subjects included normal children, mildly handicapped children residing in one of three special education settings varying from partial to total instructional segregation, and children with academic difficulties who remained solely in regular classes. In the first contrast, the handicapped samples were found comparable in self-concept to normal children, a finding hypothesized as resulting from the increased homogeneity of ability of students in special education placements. Strong support was given a second prediction positing that lower self-concept should be clearly evident when children (handicapped or not) were forced to reside solely in social-comparison groups of generally greater ability. The final hypothesis, suggesting higher self-concepts for handicapped children partially rather than totally segregated from the larger school population, did not receive support. The results are interpreted in terms of the theoretical importance of social-comparison theory in understanding the influence of educational settings on children's images of their social self.

AB  -  The Cascade of Services Model has become an essential component of modern special education, but questions remain about how the Cascade actually operates and whether progams at different levels actually differ as presumed. The present study provides data relating to three areas of presumed differences between resource, self-contained, and residential programs serving emotionally disabled students: type or severity of students, amount of student integration, and allocation of teacher time. While the trends of the data indicate some validity for the assumptions implicit in the Cascade, differences between the levels of the Cascade may be overstated, and levels may overlap to the point where differences are inconsequential.

In the present study, 205 regular classroom teachers were administered the RGEPS and their responses were examined via a series of factor analyses. Results indicated that the instrument appears to measure four dimensions. These four dimensions accounted for only 42 percent of the total variance. Moreover, the observed factor solution did not validate the various scores and subscores specified in the RGEPS Manual. Estimates of internal consistency for the scores and subscores of the RGEPS were also modest.

AB  -  The purpose of this study was to investigate the racial composition of mental retardation (MR), speech impairment (SPEECH), serious emotional disturbance (SED), and specific learning disability (SLD) classes in California during 1981. The basic unit of analysis was 96 Special Education Local Planning Areas (SELPAs) representing all school districts in the state. Using the criteria established by the court in the Diana and Larry P. cases, findings indicate that Hispanic students continue to be overrepresented in approximately one fourth of the SELPAs in MR, SPEECH, and SLD programs. Black students are overrepresented in MR and SPEECH programs in approximately one-fourth of the SELPAs, but in nearly two-thirds of the SELPAs in SLD programs. Minority students are overrepresented in SLD programs more frequently than in other program types.

AB  -  Special education is growing at an accelerating rate. Over 4 million students are receiving special services; the federal cost for assistance to states in selected aspects of that education is approaching a billion dollars. For this article, the incidence figures in a sample of school districts were calculated. During the 1977-78, 1978-79, and 1979-80 school years, 4 to 5% of the students were referred and evaluated; 3% were placed in special education programs. Wide variation was evident in the data supplied by individual school districts (some reporting placement incidence as high as 21% of their school population). The results are viewed as evidence of a need for proactive thinking in special education with regard to a reasonable rate of growth relative to the likelihood of reduced financial support.

AB  -  Public Law 94–142 mandates special educational placement decisions based on multidisciplinary and multifaceted assessments. Nevertheless, some diagnostic data have significantly greater impacts upon the decision-making process than others. Four samples—20 school psychology graduate trainees, 20 special education trainees, 20 school psychology practitioners, and 20 special education practitioners—independently rated 16 pieces of diagnostic data on their importance in determining a student's special educational placement. Results indicated that classroom observation, assessments of expressive and receptive language, an interview with the referred child, and emotional indicators were most important to the decision. There were no significant differences between the ratings of the four samples.

Data were collected for 2,752 students from 22 school districts in two states. In one state approximately 30% of the graduates were placed in regular classrooms while in the other state 16% were found in regular classrooms. An analysis of the data by severity of disability revealed that approximately 80% of severely handicapped preschool graduates in both states were placed in self-contained special education classrooms.

AB  -  Two reported effects of the labeling process in special education were investigated in a study which assessed the self-concepts of 48 learning-disabled (LD) children, 54 of their normal age-mates, and 16 regular class students whose teachers indicated the need for special education services. In addition, the mothers of children in each group were asked to complete the same self-concept instrument, responding to the items as they predicted their children would respond. Self-concepts of the children groups were compared to test the hypothesis that labeling and segregating the educationally handicapped from the larger school population might reduce self-regard. Mothers' self-concept predictions were compared to the scores of their LD children to test the hypothesis that labeling a child may reduce parents' perceptions of the child's feelings of self-worth. Predictions made by mothers of normal children were used to assess the accuracy of prediction across the parenting groups. The results gleaned from mothers of low-achieving, regular-class students were used as a method of control in case of a possibility that parental predictions were influenced more by the child's achievement than by special education placement. Equivalence of self-concept across the regular and special-class children groups was interpreted through social comparison theory and the possibility that reduced heterogeneity of ability evident in special classes may bolster the self-concept of children educated in such environments. The lowered estimates of self-concept generated by mothers of LD students were discussed as an indirect effect of the labeling process whereby the label alters the perceptions of significant others as to the abilities of the labeled individual.

AB  -  Despite its federal stature, Public Law 94-142 allows each state to generate its own procedures for identifying exceptional children. While some states categorically label their exceptional children and others do not, the educational and attitudinal effects of these procedures are generally untested. In the present study, regular and special educators from New York (a labeling state) and Massachusetts (a nonlabeling state) completed the Rucker-Gable Educational Programming Scale (RGEPS), which measures mainstreaming attitudes and special placement knowledge. Four independent samples were evaluated in these two areas as a first step toward investigating the impact of state categorization procedures (New York vs. Massachusetts) and educational profession (regular vs. special educator). A number of complex results, possible interpretations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Subjects were asked to make educational placement decisions for each case study, with half receiving the data in an IQ-adaptive behavior scale order, and half in the reverse order. Results indicated that the school psychology and special education students and practitioners did not differ in their relative uses of the data in the decision-making process, and that all subjects consistely made placements in least restrictive environments. Educational placements across the four case studies differed both with respect to the differential influence of IQ and adaptive behavior data and the order of presentation. The complexity of the placement process and educational implications are discussed.

Two hundred and twenty-three children, coded as buy-a-year (BAY), overplaced (OP), or traditional (TR) based on their Gesell placement status, were studied. There were no significant differences between the TR, BAY, or OP children on their referrals to or classification as handicapped by the COH or on their receipt of speech and language services, remedial reading, remedial math, or counseling. Significantly more (p >.05) BAY children were referred to the adaptive motor and resource room program than were either the TR or OP children. Information on the children's placement in a program for the gifted and sixth grade reading groups is also presented.

AB  -  Examines the decision-making processes of administrators, psychologists, teachers, and nurses in their judgments about the learning disabled based upon a theoretical framework provided by Brunswick (1952). Judges were first asked to rate the value of cues considered in judgments about the learning disabled including academic achievement, behavior disorder, intellectual functioning, neurological indicators, and socioeconomic status. Judges were next asked to rate the severity and make a placement recommendation for hypothetical case histories. Next, these data were used to calculate linear stepwise multiple regression equations approximating the judgmental processes of the different judges. The results indicated that judges did differ with respect to the weights assigned specific cues but were similar in their ratings of severity level and recommended educational placement. The obtained regression equations reflected the differential weighting of cues with academic achievement and behavior disorder accounting for the largest proportions of variance. Additionally, cues indicating level of intellectual functioning and socioeconomic status explained only minimal amounts of variance. Reliability estimates found the regression equation to be useful approximations of the decision-making processes of judges.

C2  - The study employs a discriminant analysis with several instruments extensively utilized by researchers. Results indicated most of the measures employed were potentially capable of discriminating behavior disordered from learning disabled children and their normal peers. A high percentage of children in each group were appropriately classified by school psychologists. (Author/DWH)

AB  -  A major principle of federal special education policy is assuring fairness in the identification and placement process. In a study of local implementation, such protections failed to occur consistently since the pivotal decision in the process continued to be the teacher's personal decision to initiate a referral. The limitations of federal special education policy are discussed in relation to both the difficulty of protecting students from inaccurate identification and those system-wide problems in current special education delivery patterns that may contribute to such difficulties.

AB  -  This study was designed to investigate the influence and utility of information about children's temperament in the processes of assessment of educational risk and the implementation of intervention approaches. A sample of 54 risk students and 54 matched students were examined at three levels of assessment of decision making— identification, classification, and instruction (within the classroom). Results from a series of discriminant analysis procedures reveal that the temperament information had little or no utility with respect to the administrative decisions concerning identification and classification. Multiple regression analyses documented significant relationships between the temperament factors and teachers' classroom monitoring decisions. Temperament information is most useful in terms of guiding adaptive instruction at the instructional level. Implications for teacher training in order to maintain risk students within the mainstream are discussed.

AB  -  California, a state rich in special education tradition, has experimented with a variety of approaches to eligibility and placement of children with learning or behavior disorders. These policies and procedures are discussed with reference to their impact in determining which children are actually served under the categories of mental retardation, learning disabilities, and emotional disturbance, as defined in Public Law 94--142. Major differences in growth or decrease of children served exist in these three categories between California and national figures. A special education “no man's land,” perhaps unique to California, may be emerging in that current policies may lead to even greater numbers of children no longer eligible for special education.

Behavioral rating scales were completed by teachers on 1,078 behaviorally disordered students assigned to (a) resource rooms in public schools, (b) self-contained classrooms in public schools, (c) psychiatric hospitals, (d) residential treatment centers, and (e) state training schools for the adjudicated. The data indicate that some differences do exist across settings and that this topic warrants research priority.

AB  -  In a study of three metropolitan high school programs for the deaf, a matched groups design was used to assess the relative effects of placement in an integrated class on the mathematics achievement of hearing impaired adolescents. The mathematics achievement of a group of 36 students in mainstreamed mathematics classes was compared with a group of 44 students in self-contained classes matched on the variables of mathematics ability, reading ability, degree of hearing loss, and social adjustment. An analysis of covariance controlling for prior achievement, sex, ethnicity, and degree of hearing loss showed that the integrated students performed significantly better than the students in the self-contained classes. A ‘post-hoc’ model of the differences in the instructional process is proposed to account for the differences which includes (a) higher expectations, (b) exposure to greater quantities of demanding material, (c) availability of individual support, and (d) training in academic content for regular mathematics teachers. The authors propose that differences are attributable to alterable factors in placements.

AB  -  Two hypotheses derived from social comparison tested the influence of instructional segregation on the self-concepts of elementary school gifted children. The self-concept scores of half the children were assessed prior to their participation in a one-day-per-week segregated enrichment program for the gifted. The remaining children were tested during program participation. The higher self-concept scores of students assessed prior to the program were interpreted as support for the contention that the reduced heterogeneity of ability in gifted classrooms forces some gifted children to see their abilities in a less favorable light. Each group was further divided by high and low IQ scores (a misnomer). The lowest self-concept scores accrued to low IQ children assessed during program participation. This was interpreted as support for the notion that transition to segregated classes for the gifted most dramatically affects the self-concepts of those children who are at the low end of the distribution of abilities within gifted classes. The self-concept scores of all groups of gifted children were generally robust, but the findings of this study underscore the important influence of children's social/instructional environments on self-concept.

AB  -  A recent investigation of the role of the regular classroom teacher in the IEP process revealed that teachers have a substantial amount of discretion in implementing the due process and service provision requirements of V.L. 94–142, resulting in some innovative and controversial practices (Nevin, Semmel, & McCann, 1981). More than half of a sample of elementary school teachers indicated that they regularly sent nonhandicapped students to special education classrooms for a variety of activities, including instruction and socialization. The present report provides additional data on these “reverse mainstreaming” practices based on a subsequent analysis of the Nevin et al. findings. The special education programs to which nonhandicapped students were sent, the reasons teachers gave for reverse mainstreaming, and factors related to reverse mainstreaming are explored. Implications for special education policy and practice are discussed.

The purpose of the present study has been to examine the English as a Second Language Placement Examination (ESLPE) employed at the University of California, to determine the nature, direction and extent of bias present for members of two linguistically and culturally diverse subgroups of the sample of examinees. By comparison of the response patterns of 34 native speakers of Spanish and 77 native speakers of Chinese from among a total sample of 312 students tested with one form of the test, it was possible to identify test items exhibiting bias in their respective skill domains. Included is a discussion of the nature, direction, extent and implications of the bias detected.

AB  -  Differences in the social behavior of learning disabled and behaviorally disordered students as a function of age and placement were investigated using teacher ratings of classroom behavior. Resource and special class teachers of the learning disabled and behaviorally disordered at the elementary and secondary levels reported the proportions of students in their classrooms exhibiting each of five patterns of deviant behavior: withdrawn-seclusive; anxious-fearful; hyperactive; aggressive; and rule-breaking. Their responses were categorized in an 8-cell, level x placement x classification matrix and separate statistical tests were conducted for each behavior pattern. Significant differences were obtained for classification on all five patterns, for level on rule-breaking, and for placement on anxiety and rule-breaking. Behaviorally disordered students exhibited more of each of the problem behaviors than did learning disabled students; secondary students exhibited more rule-breaking than elementary students; and more anxious, fearful behavior and rule-breaking were exhibited in special classes than resource rooms. These results are related to the literature on differential classification, developmental trends in behavioral disorders, and differential placement.

AB  - Data from 5284 fifth‐grade students and 886 teachers in 94 elementary schools are used to examine two aspects of the prevalence and effects of resegregation in desegregated schools. First we explore teacher and school characteristics that affect how teachers organize opportunities for intergroup contact and academic learning in their classrooms. Results suggest that positive attitudes toward integration influence teachers' selection of grouping practices that promote student interaction, such as active learning and equal‐status programs. Negative attitudes toward integration, or teachers' beliefs in separate education for blacks and whites, promote their use of less flexible, resegregative practices, such as tracking and within‐class grouping. Next, with data from teachers and students, we investigate whether different classroom organizations influence black and white students' achievement and behavior. Multiple regression analyses show that, with other important student, teacher, and classroom structures controlled, less resegregative classroom structures are more advantageous for black students' achievement. There is higher black achievement in classrooms using equal‐status programs, cooperative activities, or flexible tracking.

AB  -  Staffed by a team of regular and special educators and funded by a combination of regular and special education monies, an intermediary setting, the “Learning Laboratory,” was established for learning disabled and low-achieving adolescents. Students' academic abilities were not strong enough for regular class placement, but not so weak as to require a special education resource setting. After a year of participation, analyses of pre- and post-academic measures indicated that sixth to eighth grade learning disabled students demonstrated significant reading gains when compared with control students; ninth to twelfth grade learning disabled students did not demonstrate academic gains. However, subsequent analyses of school attendance data showed a significantly higher absenteeism rate for low-achieving students across sixth to eighth and ninth to twelfth grades. Results indicate that while some learning disabled students may benefit from such a setting, non-special education students may respond negatively to being placed with exclusively learning disabled students in certain classes.

AB  -  This study addresses the issue of achievement-potential discrepancy by applying a standard-score and regression-analysis procedure to data on new LD placements. Questionnaires were mailed to a random sample of teachers of LD students in Kansas and Iowa. Results indicated that only two-thirds of the initially placed pupils exhibited a severe discrepancy. A comparison between IQ scores of underachievers and non-underachievers suggested that the latter tended to be slow learners. A comparison between the results of the standard-score and regression-analysis procedures revealed a large overlap between the two as well as a statistically significant relationship. The use or nonuse of the regression analysis did not have the expected effects on identifying a severe discrepancy.

AB  -  Characteristics of classroom placements were studied for a probability sample of approximately 950 special needs children enrolled in kindergarten through sixth grade in five major metropolitan school districts. Across all special education students, 58% spent the majority of their school day in a regular class, 38% spent the majority of their school day in a special class, and 4% attended special schools. The regular classes in which special education children were enrolled resembled other regular classes in overall size and student composition. By contrast, special classes were smaller and more heterogeneous, and classes in special schools were especially small and heterogeneous. The proportion of time spent in regular education varied significantly both by the child's primary handicap and the school district in which the child lived, but sizable variations also were found within disability groups and within districts. For learning-disabled, mentally retarded, and physically/multiply handicapped children, variations in placement were found to be associated with student socioeconomic status and race or ethnicity.

AB  -  This study investigated school districts which made high use (HU) and those which made low use (LU) of a placement option in which special education students are fully assigned to regular classrooms. In Massachusetts the proportions of these students in respect to other special education students do not fit the base of the cascade "pyramid" which is usually envisioned as a paradigm for placement of students in the least restrictive environment commensurate with their special needs. Special education administrators, special education teachers, regular teachers, and principals responded to questionnaires designed to elicit their beliefs about issues surrounding mainstreaming and the placement of special education students. HU special education administrators were generally more positive than LU special education administrators about mainstreaming and placement issues. HU teachers were more positive than LU teachers on a number of issues, and principals as a group were dramatically more positive than teachers on almost every issue. Principals and regular teachers in the HU districts had received significantly greater amounts of inservice training than had principals and regular teachers in the LU districts. The influence of special education administrators on mainstreaming beliefs is discussed and an explanation is offered for the differences between principals and teachers.

AB  -  This study examines Harrington's hypothesis that blacks obtain lower mean scores on mental tests as a result of their small representation in the test development population. Two new intelligence test forms—a black form and a white form—were constructed using maximally unequal numbers of blacks and whites. Results indicated that blacks did not perform significantly better on the test form developed solely on their own item statistics. Bias in predictive validity was also investigated and noted to occur on the intercepts of some of the regression lines. These findings indicate that using equal or unequal numbers of blacks and whites in test development samples results in the same findings of little or no differential construct and predictive validity of intelligence tests across racial groups as reported in studies with tests developed using population proportionate sampling procedures. Differences in special education placement rates of black children, though related to black-white differences in mean IQs, are not due to the phenomenon described by Harrington.

AB  -  This study determined whether different types of special education placements affected children's attitudes toward learning handicapped peers in a school where no clinical labels were used. Traditionally these peers would have been labeled “learning disabled” and “educable mentally retarded.” Seventy-seven fourth- through sixth-graders judged the capabilities of peers depicted in written vignettes as attending one of two types of placement: a resource room or a special classroom. These placements were identical to those found in the children's school. Children saw resource room targets as significantly more capable than special class targets. This indicated that educational placements alone could act as de facto labels. Older children were found to have higher expectations of peers regardless of placement. Implications for teachers and researchers were discussed.

Thirty-six percent of the respondents had school-aged children who were receiving special education services. The majority of parents had positive feelings about special education, although parents of learning disabled students perceived their children and their children's educational needs differently from parents of mildly mentally retarded students. Parents had given permission for special education placement, but it was found that they lacked the information essential for making informed decisions.

AB  -  This research presents an analysis of learning disabilities from a social-policy perspective. The reading performance of three groups of elementary students was systematically measured during the spring of the school year: regular education students receiving no supplemental instructional services, regular education students receiving remedial Chapter 1 services, and students labeled as learning disabled. The measures consisted of Curriculum-Based Assessment procedures, following the format developed at the Institute for Research on Learning Disabilities at the University of Minnesota. Students' reading performance was compared across the three groups, including the means and semi-interquartile ranges. A discriminant function analysis was applied to predict group membership. The three groups were sorted by level of reading skill with (a) very different means, (b) minimum overlap, and (c) high accuracy in classification. The results support the notion that schools may be consistent in their decision making and allocation of service delivery on the basis of students' classroom achievement. Regardless of legal or scientific definition, it is argued that schools widely employ a social-policy definition of learning disabilities designed to serve students most deficient in achievement.

AB  -  In an attempt to extend our knowledge about potential implications of person dimensionality for language test validation, the study reported here was designed: (1) to identify person similarities in a language proficiency testing data set; (2) to attempt to relate such person dimensions to demographic information on the persons so as to provide appropriate labels for the dimensions; and (3) to investigate differential item functioning for the person dimensions identified and labelled. This final focus of the study was intended to reveal whether test items were functioning in an equivalent and valid manner for all person dimensions and, if not, whether there were any discernible patterns of item types that were functioning differentially for particular person dimensions.

AB  -  The purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which intellectual, achievement, and behavioral data would predict the placement of students with learning disabilities into a special program. The data were obtained from evaluations conducted on 95 students who were referred for evaluation of learning problems. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that only 33% of the variance was accounted for by the battery of assessment instruments in deciding whether to place a student in a learning disabilities classroom. With regard to placement of students with learning disabilities in full-or part-time learning disabilities classrooms, the test data accounted for only 27% of the variance. Thus a large portion of the variance was not accounted for by the assessment data. Implications for future research were discussed.

Placement data were collected on 582 children from three cohorts of children who left preschools in 10 Washington State school districts. Data indicate that 36% of these children were initially placed in regular education settings and 64% were placed in special education or resource settings. The stability of these placements 1 year and 2 years after graduation were high, with stability rates ranging from 75% to 100%. Of the children who made placement changes, 28% moved to less restrictive settings. Further questions to be asked as the data collection continues over the next few years are whether the current trends will continue and if placement in a less restrictive setting leads to better achievement.

AB  -  A questionnaire was mailed to a special education teacher in each of the 127 high schools in the state of Arizona. The questionnaire included demographic information and five questions related to career and vocational education for mildly handicapped students. Most high schools report administering vocational interest inventories, but less than 60% actually use the results when placing students into vocational programs. Analysis of the data after categorizing schools as rural, urban, and suburban indicates significantly different responses on three of the five questions, with fewer rural schools administering interest inventories, using the results of such inventories for placement, and placing mildly handicapped students in special vocational programs.

Comparison of pre- and postscores on the reading, math, and language subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery indicated no significant differences in performance among elementary-school students with learning disabilities in integrated classrooms and resource classrooms. Comparisons of California Achievement Test scores indicated no significant differences among regular education students in the ICM and in regular classrooms. The ICM was shown to be more cost effective than resource room programs while achieving similar results.

Teachers were assessed on the Teacher Effectiveness Evaluation Form (TEEF), covering research-based practices for effective instruction for low-achieving students. Self-report instruments measured teachers' tolerance for maladaptive behavior and their propensity to resist placement of handicapped students in their classes. Those teachers with the most effective teaching strategies for low-achieving students tended to report (a) that they tolerate less maladaptive behavior in their classrooms and (b) that they may actively resist placement of handicapped students in their rooms.

AB  -  The American Indian student is underrepresented in programs for the gifted and talented, particularly in nonreservation schools. With reference to the research of cognitive psychologists, definitions of giftedness and talent are formulated that apply to all cultural groups. The relationship between these “generic” definitions and definitions that are specific to the Indian cultures that have been studied is explained. Special considerations need to be kept in mind when trying to locate gifted and talented Indian students through the use of standardized tests. A number of methods for identifying these students are discussed.

C2  - Examines the relationship between the underrepresentation of Black students in gifted education and particular school-related and socioeconomic-status-related variables. Suggests that the recruitment of additional Black teachers and investigation of alternatives to present placement practices can achieve proportional Black student representation in gifted and educable mentally retarded classes.

AB  -  The categorical stability of 523 students with mild handicaps during their school years was investigated in a retrospective study of special education records in three high schools. The students had final classifications as learning disabled (LD), educable mentally retarded (EMR), emotionally disturbed (ED), and speech impaired (SP). Twenty-four percent had at least two different classifications during their school years. In analyzing stability of classification according to the initial category designation, the least stable category was SP, and the most stable was ED. Of the students who changed classification sometime during their special education history, most had changed to one different category, but some had changed to two different categories. Most of the changes took place during the secondary years. The ED and EMR categories tended to receive proportionately more members from other categories than did the LD and SP categories. The SP category tended to receive few members from other categories of handicapping conditions, while the LD category received an intermediate number relative to its large size. The strongest predictor of reclassification was initial classification in the SP category.

AB  -  Kindergarten and preschool teachers' perceptions of the skills necessary for mainstreaming in kindergarten programs were compared using a survey methodology. The instructional strategies that these two groups of teachers use were also compared. The two groups were randomly selected from lists of kindergarten teachers and preschool programs in the state of New Jersey. The response rate was 70 % for each group. Results indicated that preschool teachers are more stringent in their perceptions of the skills necessary for mainstreaming in kindergarten than are the kindergarten teachers. Different instructional strategies are used by the groups of teachers. Results are discussed in terms of the interface between preschool programs for the handicapped and mainstream kindergarten programs.

Vignettes described a hypothetical gifted student labeled either learning disabled or nonhandicapped and from a low, middle, or high socioeconomic status background. Subjects rated their willingness to refer the described student for possible placement in a gifted program after reading the description. Results indicated that teachers of gifted children were significantly influenced by the presence of the educational label LD and the social class of the student.

AB  -  This study describes criteria preferred by teachers when recommending students for gifted programs. It also examines differences between expert and novice teachers of the gifted by comparing the preferences of preservice teachers, classroom teachers, and teachers of the gifted. The sample included 308 subjects from three states with varying definitions of giftedness.  Subjects were asked to indicate preferences from a list of 18 possible criteria. Overall, the criteria of: creativity, learns quickly and easily, initiates own learning, and curiosity, were chosen most frequently. Chi square analysis indicated several criteria for which there were significant differences among the three groups of teachers. Discriminant function analysis provided functions that distinguished among all three groups as well as between classroom teachers and teachers of the gifted. Criteria preferred by teachers of the gifted were more consistent with theorists' recommendations than were those of either classroom or preservice teachers. Implications for identification and teacher training are discussed.

AB  -  Regular classroom behavior and teacher ratings of learning disabled (LD), low average (LA), and average (AV) students were compared before and after LD placement in resource. Results showed no Preplacement differences in regular classroom behavior between LD students and their peers. At Postplacement, LD children spent significantly less time doing schoolwork and more time looking around than AV students; also, they initiated more interactions with the regular classroom teacher than LA or AV students. Regular classroom teachers rated the LD students less favorably than LA and AV students at both Pre- and Postplacement. However, according to the observational data, LD maladaptive behavior patterns appeared only at Postplacement. It was hypothesized that these patterns reflect cross-setting generalization between resource and regular classrooms.

AB  -  The state of Georgia initiated the use of a criterion-referenced test to identify students in need of academic remediation. Remediation efforts were to be mandated to foster performance on the state's minimal competency test, which is required for graduation. This paper examines the relations among criterion-referenced test scores, subsequent predicted remediation need decisions, and actual performance, without remediation, on the minimal competency test. The results indicate that an excessively large number of students would be required to be remediated who subsequently (without remediation) successfully passed the minimal competency test. Special emphasis is placed on the procedures used to establish cutoff standards and the occurrence of classification errors. Recommendations concerning the use of criterion-referenced tests for classification decisions are presented.

AB  -  The underrepresentation of minority students in programs for the gifted has been a source of concern for many years. Most recently, Van Tassel-Baska, Patton,- and Prillaman (1989) in a national survey found "... a clear underrepresentation of minority students, particularly Blacks, in gifted programs at the K-12 level ...."  Because there are so few studies dealing with the absolute efficacy of gifted programming in general, it is not surprising that fewer studies assess the impact of gifted programming on minority students. This paper combines data from two midwest cities to suggest that gifted programming has an impact on drop-out rates and college enrollment.  The data presented make it clear that minority students benefit from gifted programs and that their continuing underrepresentation in such programs is indefensible.

AB  -  The present study focused on children referred to a psychiatric outpatient facility from the regular classroom for evaluation of behavioral and school-learning problems. Behavioral problems noted during the initial evaluation for each child were coded according to a master list of over 60 behavioral characteristics grouped into seven broad categories: conduct disorders, emotional disorders, social relationship disorders, attentional disorders, hyperactivity, language disorders, and developmental delays/physical disorders. Then classroom placement recommendations were made by a school interdisciplinary team and categorized according to four classroom integration options ranging from total integration to integration for less than 1–2 hours daily. Results indicate general trends in the relationship between placement option(s) and the incidence and severity of presenting behavioral profiles. The meaning of these results is discussed in relation to research that emphasizes the lack of concordance between clinical, psychoeducational test profiles, psychiatric classification schemes, and classroom placement recommendations for special education students.

AB  -  This paper presents results from the first round of data collection for the Learning Outcomes Project at the University of Virginia, an ongoing, longitudinal investigation of over 1,100 elementary school children receiving different types of gifted services or regular classrooms. This initial report compares 5 types of services for gifted: within regular classrooms; through pull-out resource rooms; ability grouping in separate classes; special schools; no program offerings. Gifted students are also compared with two groups of students in regular classrooms: classmates of gifted students and students identified as gifted in schools without available gifted programs. Overall results indicate that students selected for all types of gifted services were well above grade level in academic achievement. There were significant differences in the achievement levels, self-concepts, and teacher ratings of students selected for different types of gifted services. These results have implications for both researchers and educators in comparing the effectiveness of different types of gifted service delivery options.

AB  - AbstractStudents in a large one‐semester nonmajors college biology course were classified into one of three groups (intuitive—I, transitional—T, reflective—R) based upon a pretest of scientific reasoning ability. Laboratory teams of two students each then were formed, such that all possible combinations of reasoning abilities were represented (i.e., I‐I, I‐T, I‐R, T‐T, T‐R, R‐R). Students worked with their assigned partners during each of the course's 14 laboratory sessions. Gains in reasoning ability, laboratory achievement, and course achievement, as well as changes in students' opinions of their motivation, enjoyment of the laboratory, and their own and their partner's reasoning abilities were assessed at the end of the semester. Significant pre‐ to posttest gains in reasoning ability by the intuitive and transitional students were found, but these gains were not significantly related to the laboratory partner's reasoning ability. Also, course achievement was not significantly related to the laboratory partner's reasoning ability. Students were perceptive of others' reasoning ability; the more able reasoners were generally viewed as being more motivated, having better ideas, and being better at doing science. Additional results also indicated that course enjoyment and motivation was significantly decreased for the transitional students when they were paired with intuitive students. Apparently, for students in transition (i.e., not at an equilibrium state with regard to reasoning level), it is frustrating to work with a less able reasoner. However, some evidence was found to suggest that reflective students may benefit from working with a less able partner.

AB  -  Recent studies concerning parental attitudes toward preschool mainstreaming indicate a favorable disposition toward this arrangement by parents of typical children and those of children with disabilities in mainstreamed settings. This study seeks to replicate and extend these findings. Discussed are the first-year results of a 5-year longitudinal study of parental attitudes toward mainstreaming in school-age programs. Surveyed were 230 parents. Results indicated that the parents, regardless of their child's preschool placement in a mainstreamed or segregated program, held very favorable opinions toward mainstreaming. However, the parents of typical children and the parents of children with disabilities in the mainstream settings indicated greater satisfaction with their child's involvement in a mixed grouping of children, and stronger opinion that this involvement influenced their child's development, than did their counterparts in the segregated settings. Correlations of these results with length of time in preschool and level of child functioning are also discussed.

AB  - Standardized and basic skills placement tesh are used routinely as indicators of academic ability and potential in academic advising. By analyzing the relationship between test scores and the academic performance patterns of more than 1,800 freshmen attending an urban public university, the authors found that basic skills placement tesh measured academic preparation more accurately than did the American College Test (ACT). However, standardized and locally developed placement tests predicted academic performance with only low to moderate reliability. In particular, the tests tended to underestimate both the academic preparation and the likelihood of satisfactory academic performance of female and non-White students.

AB  -  Teacher ratings from four consecutive cohorts of kindergarten students were used to establish a prediction function by which children who ultimately received special education services in the form of resource-class placement were discriminated from children who remained solely in regular education classrooms. All five factors measured by the RISK scale were significantly related to future school performance, but items that assessed child ability, current performance, and teacher investment were most predictive of eventual special-class placement. Overall accuracy for the screening measure was 94.13%, with 1,194 out of 1,269 children accurately selected to their appropriate educational placement.

AB  -  We investigated the influence of teacher efficacy and student problem type on teachers' placement and referral decisions. Regular and special educators ( N= 192) were randomly assigned a case study describing a student having a learning and/or behavior problem and asked to judge (a) whether the student was appropriately placed in regular education and (b) whether they would refer this student to special education. Analysis of an efficacy scale yielded two factors: personal efficacy and teaching efficacy. Results indicated that regular and special educators were most likely to agree with regular class placement when they were high in both dimensions of efficacy. Regular educators higher in personal efficacy were more likely to agree with regular education placement than those with lower personal efficacy. In addition, students with combined learning and behavior problems were found to be the most susceptible to referral. This study suggests that teachers' sense of efficacy underlies their placement decisions.

AB  -  This study was undertaken to determine whether a preschool screening instrument could predict whether kindergarten students would later be retained, referred to special education, or placed in special education. The results of Early Prevention of School Failure (EPSF) screening on 161 kindergarten students were examined. Students who had been retained, referred to special education, or placed in special education demonstrated significantly lower EPSF pretest scores except in the gross motor modality. All EPSF modalities were statistically significant predictors of students' status; however, other factors such as family support network, preschool experiences, and motivational factors must be considered in evaluating whether a student is “at risk” of later school failure.

AB  -  A longitudinal study of 451 deaf adolescents in 15 local school districts across the United States addressed the cumulative impact of mainstream placement on achievement and grade point average (GPA). Initial between-group differences accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in actual achievement but less so for GPA. Advantages accrued to the more mainstreamed students; however, this may be as much related to overall course selection during high school as to the degree of mainstreaming of the student. Students who attended more classes and attended more academically demanding classes did have higher achievement levels across placement categories. The apparent cumulative effect of mainstream placement may be as much a product of different patterns of educational programming as of the advantage of a specific placement. Race as an expression of a constellation of variables was the largest factor in achievement differences but did not affect cumulative GPA.

AB  - AbstractIn this study we describe the social interactions of ability‐grouped dyads as they constructed knowledge of balance concepts to elucidate the relationship between interactions and conceptual growth. The verbal and nonverbal behaviors of 30 fifth‐grade students were recorded as they completed three activities related to balance. These student interactions were examined within a framework of social cognition. For each dyad, characteristics of ability‐grouped dyads were identified. Results revealed that high‐achieving students effectively used prior experiences, maintained focus on the learning task, and were able to manipulate the equipment effectively to construct knowledge. Low‐achieving students exhibited off‐task behavior, lacked a metacognitive framework for organizing the learning tasks, centered on irrelevant features of the equipment, and were unable to use language effectively to mediate learning. Within low‐high student dyads, high‐achieving students typically modeled thinking processes and strategies for manipulating equipment. In addition, they focused the low‐achieving students on the components of the tasks while verbally monitoring their progress, thus enabling low students to identify the critical features necessary for concept construction. These results highlighted the differences that students have in the use of language and tools. Low students' inefficient use of tools has implications for the ways science teachers structure lessons and group students for laboratory work.

AB  - AbstractThis study describes the effects of ability‐paired student interactions on achievement as fifth graders (10‐year‐olds) worked on laboratory activities relating to balance. Achievement gains were assessed (n = 83) by analysis of pretest–posttest differences on the lever concept test. Audio recordings and field notes (n = 30) were analyzed for the following laboratory behaviors: number of words spoken, tinkering, block moving, turns speaking, incidence of helping and distracting behavior. Results revealed that: (1) low‐ability student achievement is greater when students are paired with high‐ability partners; (2) low‐ability students speak more words, exhibit less distracting behavior, and move blocks on the lever less when they are paired with a partner of high ability; (3) high‐ability students speak more words, take more turns speaking, and exhibit more helping behaviors when they are paired with low‐ability students rather than with other high ability students; and (4) there are no achievement differences for high‐ability students regardless of the ability level of their partner. These findings suggest that heterogeneous grouping of students in science can be beneficial to low‐ability students partnered with high‐ability students, without being detrimental to the high‐ability partners.

AB  -  This study examined early childhood placement as a function of child characteristics in terms of chronological age, severity of disability, developmental status, functional abilities, and behavioral characteristics. The study sample consisted of 162 children (69 in specialized programs and 93 in inclusive settings) ranging in age from 11 to 102 months ( M = 47.5 months). Children were assessed on the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI), the ABILITIES Index, and the Carolina Record of Individual Behavior (CRIB). In general, children enrolled in inclusive programs were found to be more mildly disabled and functioning at higher levels than their counterparts enrolled in programs designed exclusively for children with disabilities. A discriminant function analysis revealed that overall agreement between actual and predicted placement based on child characteristics was 75%, suggesting that other factors may have affected placement decisions for some children. The interaction between chronological age and type of placement was statistically significant for the BDI and approached significance for the CRIB. Implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB  -  The present article describes the results of two surveys camparing the perceptions of educators of gifted students with the perceptions of mainstream educational personnel in middle schools and those specializing in cooperative learning. The results indicated a major gulf between the of mainstream educators and those of educators of the gifted. In the case of middle schools, the disagreement focused on the value of ability grouping and the social consequences of being labeled gifted. In the case of cooperative learning, there were major differences across the board on practically all items.  The authors conclude that it is in the interest of all concerned to have more extensive dialogue between educators of the gifted and members of the educational reform movement.

AB  -  Using qualitative methodology, this study investigated the effects of special education placement from the perspectives of nine high school students receiving learning disabilities services in separate classrooms. Three topics were investigated: peer acceptance, perceptions of self, and perceived efficacy of learning disabilities programs. Results indicated that students did not view their special education experiences as either socially or academically efficacious. Nevertheless, they valued the services because separate settings had provided means to avoid an unresponsive general education system. Students viewed the movement for integration of general and special education services as unrealistic. They perceived existent general education as unable and unwilling to adapt to individual student needs.

AB  - Educators involved in full inclusion programs for deaf or hard of hearing children were asked to rate the impact of these programs on both D/HH and hearing children. Three criteria were used: academic achievement, social adjustment, and self-confidence/ esteem. Raters also described the degree to which each of 27 educational conditions were present in their school. These conditions were combined into five categories and scales were constructed for assessing each. χ 2 was employed to discover relationships between educational conditions and the three criteria. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict student outcomes on the basis of the five scales. The impact of full inclusion was more favorable if D/HH children received social encouragement, if a full range of placement options were available, and if teachers and parents supported the program.

AB  -  Few definitive answers exist as to the implications of ability grouping for children's development. Perhaps the most significant source of this inconclusiveness has been the absence of a longitudinal perspective and long-term studies of the effects of ability grouping on children's development. To address this need, this study examined the long-term correlates of being placed in an ability-grouped mathematics class on entry into junior high school. Results revealed some negative and no positive correlates at the tenth-grade level for low-ability students placed in low-ability classrooms compared with their peers placed in ungrouped classrooms. Conversely, a number of positive correlates of ability grouping were found for medium- and high-ability students. Discussion focuses on the role of ability grouping in junior high school as a sorting event which sets youths on different trajectories that have implications for their later academic, career; and personal development.

AB  -  Perceptions of 680 licensed general and special education teachers and administrators related to the full inclusion of all students, including students with moderate and severe disabilities, were assessed using the Heterogeneous Education Teacher Survey and the Regular Education Initiative Teacher Survey-Revised. Respondents were from 32 school sites judged as providing heterogeneous educational opportunities for all children. Results favored the education of children with disabilities in general education through collaborative relationships among all educators—contradicting previous results suggesting that educators prefer pullout programs. For both general and special educators, administrative support and collaboration were powerful predictors of positive attitudes toward full inclusion.

AB  -  Combination classes (also termed split or multigrade classes) are a form of classroom grouping that typically occurs when school enrollments are imbalanced or inadequate, resulting in teachers’ managing students from two or more grades for most or all of the school day. These expediently formed classes, embedded within a graded system of schooling, therefore differ significantly from multiage or nongraded classes, formed deliberately because of pedagogical or philosophical interests in team teaching, flexible grouping, individualized instruction, continuous progress curriculum, and the elimination of all vestiges of gradedness. This exploratory study compared the curriculum, instructional strategies, and organizational formats used by six combination class teachers for mathematics with those used by eighteen single-grade teachers (six who used traditional whole-class teaching and twelve who used two within-class ability groups). Results showed that the instruction, classroom organization, and curriculum content and materials of combination class teachers differed in significant ways from those of both traditional whole-class and within-class ability-grouped (two-group) single-grade teachers. Observers’ ratings and low-inference measures indicated that combination classes included fewer instances of peer cooperation, innovative curriculum, and individualized instruction. Furthermore, teacher-directed and independent-group variables (e.g., meaningful presentations, use of manipulatives, higher-level thinking emphasis) varied significantly among these three grouping formats.

These students were placed into general education classrooms for reading for up to 12 weeks. Effects were evaluated using Curriculum-Based Measurement. Achievement gains for reintegrated students were evaluated in the context of the academic gains made by general education students in the same reading groups. Results showed that on average, reintegrated students made academic gains comparable with their general education counterparts. Parents and general education teachers responded favorably to the reintegration decision, and their support did not change over the course of the reintegration trial.

C2  - A transitional &quot;pre-first-grade&quot; program (for kindergarten &quot;graduates&quot; judged unready for first grade) has been operating in the Irving (Texas) Independent School District since the early 1980s. This evaluation, comparing three sets of students (participating pre-first-grade students, nonparticipating refusers who entered first grade, and those directly promoted to first grade), found the program ineffective.

C2  - Hostility towards intelligence tests is based on perception that such instruments are decisive in placing ethnic and linguistic minority students in ineffective educational placements. It is imperative that discussions about intelligence and cognition be guided by the presupposition that there are certain cross-cultural skills all students must achieve to be successful in school and in their vocations.

AB  -  This study compared three levels of inclusion (special education-only, integrated special education, and mainstream placements) on cognitive and language development of preschool children with disabilities. Results are reported for 66 children randomly assigned to one of three classroom ratios. Overall, treatments did not differ significantly, but an analysis of pre- to postgains revealed that one treatment, integrated special education, produced gains that significantly exceeded the rate of normal development. Aptitude X Treatment interactions indicated relatively higher functioning children with disabilities benefited more from integrated special education placement, while relatively lower functioning children benefitted more from special education-only classes and mainstream classes. Results replicate previous findings that different levels of inclusion produce differential benefits for higher and lower functioning students.

AB  -  Notwithstanding the historical persistence of the disproportionate representation of ethnic minority students in special education, there is a scarcity of research on factors affecting the placement of minority students in these programs. The purpose of this study was to identify placement predictors in learning disabilities (LD) programs for Latino, African-American, and Anglo students. We used 12 predictor variables from two key domains (student and family) and used placement data from a national database of eighth-grade students. We found that although some factors predicted placement in LD programs for all ethnic groups, placement predictors also varied by student ethnicity. Based on these findings, we provide implications for research and practice from a sociocultural perspective.

AB  -  One of the most controversial issues currently facing educators is the extent to which students with learning disabilities should be included in general education classrooms. Although this issue has received much interest in professional literature, few data are available regarding placement trends for these students over time. This investigation was designed to address this issue by examining data from Reports to Congress regarding placement practices for students with learning disabilities over the last 6 years. The results revealed that students with learning disabilities are being educated in increasingly less restrictive settings, although placement practices differ considerably from state to state. The implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

AB  -  This qualitative study analyzed the process of inclusive education experienced by parents of children with severe disabilities. Based on interviews with 20 parents, the study found that the process of inclusion extends beyond the parents' initial placement decision to their ongoing involvement at the school site. At the schools, parents actively participate in the work of inclusion. At the same time, the parents become entrepreneurs of meaning, shaping the definition and reality of inclusive education for their children.

AB  -  Due to the significant over-representation of rural culturally diverse students identified as learning disabled, this study investigated the effects of modifying the discrepancy formula between intelligence and achievement. This formula is commonly used to identify and place school-age students in programs for children and youth with learning disabilities. Three modifications were applied to the discrepancy formula using a sample of 123 students currently being served in classes for children and youth with learning disabilities in a rural Mississippi school district. The results indicated that modifying the assessment protocol and raising the minimum full scale IQ to 85 in the discrepancy formula resulted in the greatest reduction to the over-representation of rural culturally diverse students assessed for learning disabilities. Suggestions for future research in this area are offered.

AB  -  Alhough Asian American students are underrepresented in special education, recent studies have highlighted concerns about the cultural and linguistic appropriateness of the identification and placement process. This study examined the characteristics of Asian American elementary students with learning disabilities (LD) in a school district in the Southwest that was selected because it served the largest number of Asian American students with LD in the state. Due to the small numbers of students served, the sample included all Asian American students with LD in Grades K to 5 (N = 26). Variables of interest included students' demographic characteristics, factors associated with referral, assessment practices and student profiles, and instructional recommendations for special education services. The results suggest that the experiences of Asian American students with LD are similar to those of Mexican American students with LD reported in earlier studies. These findings also reflect the challenges faced by educators in providing appropriate educational services for language minority students.

AB  -  The Teacher's Report Form (TRF) was investigated over 3 years for its practical ability to track the outcome in 89 elementary school students with serious emotional disturbance (SED). The pupils who remained in SED programming the entire time were characterized as unchanged by serial TRF's.The students whose placement was changed over the course of the study to less restrictive settings by school staff unaware ofTRF findings demonstrated significant improvement on consecutive TRF's in academic performance, classroom functioning, and aggressive behaviors.Those students who were placed in more intensive SED settings over time had TRF results that indicated significant generalized worsening without academic or classroom improvement. Overall, the TRF shows promise as an empirical supplement to the current less objective approaches used by school teams during their yearly individualized education program (IEP) assessment and subsequent placement and treatment planning for students with SED.

AB  - Although placement in less restrictive settings is generally believed to be associated with more positive social outcomes for students with disabilities, the empirical research has yielded equivocal findings. The purpose of this study was to synthesize the empirical research comparing the self–concept of students with learning disabilities (LD) in different educational placements. Meta–analysis revealed no overall association between self–concept and educational placement for four out of five comparisons: regular class vs. resource room, regular class vs. self–contained class, resource room vs. self–contained class, and regular class vs. special school. Students with LD receiving instruction in self–contained classrooms in regular schools exhibited lower self–concept compared to students with LD attending special schools. Follow–up analyses were conducted to explore whether the variability of effect sizes in regular class–resource room comparisons was associated with any of several potential moderator variables; the only variable for which the association approached significance was whether students in the regular classroom were provided with appropriate special education supports and services. The findings are discussed in light of documented individual variation in students’ placement preferences.

C2  - A meta-analysis of 40 studies investigated the self-concept of students with learning disabilities (LD) in different educational placements. No association between self-concept and placement was found for four of five comparisons. However, students with LD in self-contained classrooms in regular schools exhibited lower self-concept compared to those attending special schools. (Contains references.) (Author/CR)

AB  -  This study investigated the relationship between placement in inclusive and pullout special education programs and academic and behavior outcomes for students with learning disabilities (LD). Demographic data such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and IQ established comparabililty of two groups. Qualitative and quantitative methods described two schools and their special education models, one inclusive and the other pullout. Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goals and objectives, classroom accommodations, and teacher collaboration were examined to provide functional definitions. Results indicated that the two programs differed significantly. Further, students served in inclusive classrooms earned higher grades, achieved higher or comparable scores on standardized tests, committed no more behavioral infractions, and attended more days of school than students served in the pullout program.

C2  - This paper reviews research on grouping of students within classes and its effects on learning. Primary consideration is given to grouping and mixing students by ability, though consideration is also given to grouping and mixing students by ethnicity and gender as well as to research on the effects of group size. Results of meta-analyses of grouping show a small but meaningful advantage of forming students into groups for instruction as compared to using whole-class instruction. In teacher-led, homogeneous ability groups, peer effects result from the normative environment to the extent that peers contribute to norms for behavior, constructed through cycles of reciprocal teacher-student interaction. In peer-led, heterogeneous ability groups, peer effects stem directly from group interactions and discourse among students that lead to cognitive restructuring, cognitive rehearsal, problem solving, and other forms of higher-level thinking. Similarly, in groups of different ethnic and gender composition, peer effects stem from interactions among students according to their perceived status and relative influence within the groups. We argue that these peer influences interact with instructional processes to mediate the effects of group composition on students' learning.

AB  -  This study investigated the relationship among teacher efficacy, child socioeconomic status (SES), child ethnicity, and educational placement recommendations concerning children with behavioral or emotional disorders (E/BD). For the study, 350 special education teachers were randomly selected from 10 school districts in the Denver metropolitan area. Participants completed the Expanded Teacher Efficacy Scale to measure Classroom Management/Discipline, External Influences, and Personal Teaching Efficacy. Participants also completed the Educational Placement Vignette. After reading the descriptive case study of a fourth grade boy identified as having E/BD, special educators indicated the placement option they would recommend for the student. Vignettes were identical except for variations regarding the child's SES and ethnicity. Results suggest that Classroom Management/Discipline, External Influences, and child SES are significant predictors of special education teachers’ placement recommendations. Knowledge acquired through this investigation provides a foundation for a theory concerning how educational placement decisions are determined. Recommendations are made for using the knowledge to reduce placement rates in restrictive environments, and suggestions are provided to advance the theory regarding how placement decisions are made.

AB  -  The purpose of this article was to estimate the proportion of learning disabilities placements associated with variables that can be considered markers for low socioeconomic status. A linked birth record/school record data set for the state of Florida ( n = 159,129) was utilized to examine the occurrence of learning disabilities placements among a single cohort of children with varying levels of risk at birth. Children whose birth records indicated maternal education of less than 12 years, mother unmarried at birth, prenatal care initiation after the first trimester of pregnancy, or low birthweight were at increased risk for a learning disabilities placement by the age of 12 to 14 years. Children with any one of these factors were between 1.2 and 3.4 times more likely to have a learning disability placement by age 12 to 14 years than were children without any of these factors. Analyses indicated that the rate of learning disability placement among children from low-SES backgrounds is greater than would be expected given the rate of placement among children not experiencing low SES. The proportion of placements attributable to the increased risk associated with low SES indicators on the birth certificate was 30% among boys and 39% among girls. The finding of greater-than-expected rates of learning disabilities placement among children facing risks associated with low SES suggests that alternative approaches to prevention may be needed to reduce some proportion of placements.

The study found that typically developing children in specialized classrooms had significantly more friends than did children with disabilities in those same settings. In child care settings, however, the difference between the reported number of friendships for typically developing children and their peers with disabilities did not reach statistical significance. Implications are presented for considering how the social ecology of the early childhood classroom setting may influence social outcomes for young children enrolled in inclusive programs.

AB  -  Although many cooperative learning methods advocate grouping students heterogeneously in order to maximize the diversity of perspectives, skills, and backgrounds, past research shows that heterogeneous grouping generally ben-efits low-ability students but does not necessarily benefit high-ability students. This study investigates the effects of group ability composition (homogeneous versus heterogeneous) on group processes and outcomes for high-ability students completing science performance assessments. High-ability students working in homogeneous groups uniformly performed well, and high-ability students in some heterogeneous groups performed as well as high-ability students in homogeneous groups; but high-ability students in other heterogeneous groups did not perform as well. The quality of group functioning served as the strongest predictor of high-ability students’ performance and explained much of the effect of group composition.

AB  -  The reauthorized Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) signals dramatic changes for all facets of education. This autoethnography investigates the diagnostic and placement practices in an urban school district. Analysis revealed that although the reauthorization of IDEA opens the door to transformation, educators in this study interpreted the law in ways that constrained their work. Discussion focuses on how administrators and staff members who understand the intentions of the reauthorized IDEA might view it less as a mandate and more as an opportunity to shift power.

Unlike IAT, IBA required documentation and analysis of interventions in the process of determining special education eligibility. Results favored IBA over IAT in proportions of children on team caseloads who underwent multifactored evaluation and were found eligible for special education, but not for proportion of children receiving interventions in general education settings. Implications of these findings for school-based problem-solving efforts are discussed.

AB  -  A longitudinal policy analysis was undertaken in four schools to explore the degree to which positive outcomes associated with a 1990 state policy on education reform had been sustained in the context of subsequent policies emphasizing standards-based reform and school accountability. The shifting policy context supported the sustainability of initial positive outcomes such as increased use of educational support systems and teams, but was associated with increases in referrals to special education and the use of more restrictive special education placements. Findings suggest a need to recognize shared as well as competing goals among educational policies and to explore a variety of approaches to expanding the capacity of general education to support students within the context of standards-based reform.

AB  - AbstractThe early detection of children with mild learning problems remains a problem. New screening tests are being developed that will be more effective in identifying children who fall into this “difficult to identify” group. This study examined the predictive validity of one potential screening test. The scores of 268 children on each task of a nine‐task preschool cognitive battery were evaluated in terms of the accuracy with which they predicted the classification of those same children into regular education (n = 254) or special education (n = 14) 4 years later when the children were in third grade. A classification accuracy level of 79% was achieved for the exceptional children, and a classification level of 70% for the normally achieving children. Racial/ethnic status, testing language, and socioeconomic status all impacted the children's screening performance. Lower screening scores and a greater proportion of the sample with scores below the cut were associated with minority status, not being tested in English, and lower socioeconomic status. Preschool testing in Spanish or both English and Spanish was associated with poorer achievement 4 years later. Many of the children not in special education, but with a screening score below 13, had serious academic problems in third grade that were reflected in their low percentile scores on one or more subtests of the Stanford Achievement Test. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Racial disparities in special and gifted education cannot be understood independently of a broad legacy of racial inequity woven into American public education. The results of a qualitative study illustrate the context within which minority disproportionality occurs. School respondents agreed with the NRC panel's conclusion that poverty makes an important contribution to disproportionality; yet the data suggest that the effect of poverty is by no means linear. Respondents identified a number of contextual factors contributing to racial disparities in special education placement, including high-stakes testing. In particular, we were struck by the difficulty some respondents exhibited in discussing issues of race. To ensure implementation of the panel's recommendations, it becomes highly important to address broader socio-political issues, especially denial of the existence of racial disparities in the schools.

AB  -  This article explores patterns of special education services during the elementary grades among children who participated in either the Child-Parent Center (CPC) Preschool Program or other early childhood programs in the Chicago Public Schools. The study sample included 1,377 low-income, racial minority children in the Chicago Longitudinal Study. Controlling for family background characteristics that might affect educational performance, children who participated in Child-Parent Center preschool had a significantly lower rate of special education placement (12.5%) than the comparison group (18.4%), who participated in an alternative all-day kindergarten program. The estimated impact of CPC preschool intervention was best explained by the cognitive advantage hypothesis. This article provides support for the long-term impact of the CPC preschool intervention on special education outcomes.

C2  - As IQ scores rise, IQ tests are periodically renormed, making them harder. Because eligibility for mental retardation (MR) services relies heavily on IQ scores, renormed tests could significantly impact MR placements. In longitudinal IQ records from nine sites, students with borderline and mild MR lost 5.6 points on average when retested on renormed tests and were more likely to be classified MR than peers retested on the same test.

C2  - A primary problem with special education placement is that it is a solution that comes too late for children who are first noticed by their kindergarten teachers as lacking prerequisite skills. It is of critical importance that these students, whose reading skills are low in comparison to their peers, be accurately identified through universal screenings and be provided with intervention. Most universal screening models suggest the use of curriculum-based measurement (CBM). In the current study, 77 third grade students were administered four CBM reading probes, a maze, a group-administered standardized achievement test, and reading subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson-III. Analyses were conducted to evaluate whether it is necessary to administer three rather than only one CBM reading probe, the contribution of administering a maze in addition to CBM, and the predictive validity of CBM versus a group-administered standardized achievement test.

C2  - A study was conducted at Merrimack College in Massachusetts to compare the grades of students who took the recommended course as determined by their mathematics placement exam score and those who did not follow this recommendation. The goal was to decide whether the mathematics placement exam used at Merrimack College was effective in placing students in the appropriate mathematics class. During five years, first-year students who took a mathematics course in the fall semester were categorized into four groups: those who took the recommended course, those who took an easier course than recommended, those who took a course more difficult than recommended, and those who did not take the placement test. Chi-square tests showed a statistically significant relationship between course grade (getting a C- or higher grade) and placement advice. The results indicate that students who take the recommended course or an easier one do much better than those who take a higher-level course or do not take the placement exam. With achievement in coursework as the measure of success, we concluded that the placement test is an effective tool for making recommendations to students about which courses they should take.

C2  - Community colleges utilize open-door admission policies to provide educational opportunities for all students, including those who are academically under-prepared in one or more areas. Current approaches to assisting under-prepared students include the targeted delivery of remedial courses in math, English, and reading. This approach typically relies on the use of standardized placement tests to determine whether students have remedial needs. Based on those placement test scores, students may have a remedial need in only one of the core academic areas (e.g., math, English, or reading). In such cases, students may concurrently enroll in required remedial courses and college-level courses unrelated to the area in which they are considered to be academically under-prepared. The research reported in this article evaluated the assumption that a student's under-preparednessis limited to a specific area by assessing the college-level performance of students concurrently enrolled in remedial and college-level courses. The results show that college-level pass rates are much lower among students concurrently enrolled in remedial courses who do not successfully complete one or more of these remedial courses. These students under-perform irrespective of the type of college-level course. In contrast, students who pass their remedial courses are generally successful in their college-level courses. Policy implications in regard to developmental education are discussed.

This study looked at undergraduate students' scores on a mathematics placement exam, mathematics courses taken and grades received, and persistence toward a degree. It was determined that a student's timely progress toward a four-year degree is influenced by the student's initial score on the mathematics placement exam and by subsequent performance in mathematics courses. Analysis of longitudinal data suggests that students tend to maintain the level of mathematics skills with which they entered college, and students who graduate in four years seem to increase their knowledge of elementary mathematics during this time.

C2  - Using an ex post facto analysis of outcomes data, this paper tracks the academic performances of developmental and non-developmental students and examines the effects that developmental courses have on subsequent academic progress leading up to graduation. Three-year data on developmental students and graduates were analyzed to discern the characteristics of students graduating from the College, and to compare and contrast the characteristics of developmental and non-developmental students who graduated. The College graduates were categorized into four groups with respect to their academic preparation as suggested by their placement scores. During the three-year period considered, over 61% of the College's graduates took one or more developmental courses. This study shows that there is a positive link between the number of developmental courses taken and time to graduation. Consistent with prior studies, it is remarkable that developmental students perform equally well in college level courses as non-developmental students, depending on the number of pre-college level courses taken. As higher education institutions are facing increasing demands for accountability and performance requirements, accurate assessment and placement of students needing interventions become more imperative. However, accountability measures linked to retention, graduation rates, and federal student financial aid may disadvantage community colleges, especially because roughly two-thirds of community college students attend part-time and require remediation.

C2  - In stark contrast to the recommendations of the current White Paper, Jo Boaler's recent research suggests that the radical progressive state school commitment to mixed ability teaching has, in the case of this landmark study, led to better results and better life-chances than its more traditional counterpart whose ability grouping practices created, in the words of one ex-pupil, "psychological prisons" that "break ambition" and "almost formally label kids as stupid." If ability grouping reproduces social class inequalities, any political party that really cares about social justice must look again at the norms of ability segregation that blights so much of contemporary practice. In their stead, we need equitable and effective grouping polices that promote high achievement for all.

C2  - This study investigated differences in vocabulary knowledge as a potential explanation for perceived differences between placed and promoted students in a university EAP reading course. Students in an advanced reading course (N=59) were tested on their vocabulary knowledge using the Vocabulary Levels Test Form B [Nation, I. S. P. (2001). "Learning vocabulary in another language." Cambridge: Cambridge University Press] at the beginning of the academic semester. Additionally, the promoted students' (n=29) vocabulary scores were compared to their own scores from the beginning of the intermediate course one semester earlier. Analysis of the data shows that students placed directly into the advanced reading course upon entry to the university have statistically significantly greater vocabulary knowledge than students promoted into the course after one semester of study in the EAP program. This difference was observed for both general as well as academic vocabulary knowledge. Moreover, promoted students' vocabulary scores showed no significant increase over their initial scores as intermediate students for either general or academic vocabulary knowledge despite the fact that they had taken one or more university content courses. Potential reasons for these results as well as curricular implications are discussed. (Contains 2 figures and 8 tables.)

Specifically, the study compares patterns in within-school segregation across ethnic groups, grades, boroughs, and years. Current levels of within-school segregation are also compared to levels of across-school segregation and to levels of segregation that result from three simulations where students are assigned to their classrooms: (a) randomly, (b) to achieve complete ethnic segregation, and (c) according to their prior year test scores. Results indicate that racial segregation across schools is far greater than racial segregation within schools, however the segregation of immigrants within-schools is equal to the segregation of immigrants across schools. Within-school segregation cannot be entirely attributed to random processes or to the use of ability grouping practices, particularly in the case of black and Hispanic segregation. Finally, segregation within-schools varies considerably across the five boroughs and declined during the second half of the 1990s.

It involved 262 middle and high school administrators of students who had attended a gifted summer program at a local university. Survey data showed the critical influence of the school’s policies on granting credit for outside-of-school coursework and institutional accreditation on the school’s responses. For high schools, territory or administrative issues such as the school’s own policy on credit, prior notice of a student’s participation in the program, sharing outside-of-school course syllabi with school officials in advance, the type of course, and accreditation of the summer program were crucial in decisions regarding the awarding of credit. For middle schools, the school’s own evaluation of a student’s mastery of the course content, prior notice of the student’s participation in the program, and the student’s performance in the outside-of-school course were the most significant factors that affected schools’ responses regarding appropriate placement. Findings showed that schools’ responses were conservative and that parents need to petition more actively for credit or placement for their children.

C2  - This study provides empirical evidence to support the validity of using a  content-specific reading test for college placement decisions. A content-specific reading test presents passages exclusively from the subject area for which the placement decision is intended. Forty-nine students in a human anatomy class were administered a content-specific reading test, a content general reading test, and a test of prior domain knowledge on the first day of class. In a forward-solution multiple regression, the content-specific reading test was a significant predictor (p <.01) of course grades, but neither the content-general reading test nor the knowledge test added significantly to the prediction. Thus, neither domain knowledge nor generic reading ability provided an independent contribution to the prediction, after partialing out the effects of content-specific reading ability.

C2  - Teachers with an individualized teacher frame of reference (TFR) emphasize improvement in relation to prior achievement, effort, and learning. Individualized TFRs were hypothesized to enhance self-concept and reduce the negative effects associated with the big fish little pond effect (BFLPE). Math achievement and math self-concept data (2150 students from 112 classes) were collected at the end of Grade 7 and the end of Grade 8. TFR was independently assessed by student ratings of their teacher and ratings by two trained observers. Multilevel analyses confirmed the BFLPE, the negative effect of class-average achievement on self-concept. An individualized TFR enhanced self-concept, but had no significant effect on the size of the BFLPE (the class-average achievementxTFR interaction was not significant). Results were very similar for both student and observer ratings of TFR. The findings suggest that individualized TFRs enhance academic self-concepts but do not suppress the negative effects of ability grouping.

C2  - This article focuses on the discrepancy between school personnel's negative stereotyping of African American families and the family information gleaned by ethnographic research. Using findings from a 3-year ethnographic study of the special education placement process in a culturally diverse urban school district, we describe the general atmosphere of negativity that prevailed among school personnel with regard to African American families living in poverty. The article focuses on the families of three case study students who were referred to special education. Home visits and ethnographic interviews with caregivers revealed family strengths that were neither known nor tapped by school personnel. We interpret the findings in terms of the power of cultural capital and the discrepancy between the schools' perceptions of such capital and the capital actually possessed by families.

Consistent with results at earlier follow-up points, program main effects were not significant; however, the Aptitude × Treatment interactions (ATIs) documented at earlier ages were absent. Sample differences among follow-up groups may account for the changed ATI findings. A combination of preschool child characteristics and early achievement accounted for 78% of final achievement variance. Male participants had higher achievement than female participants but were disproportionately placed in special education. Special education placement and disability classifications fluctuated over the course of schooling.

C2  - Regardless of individual differences at kindergarten entry, schools have a mission to promote reading achievement for all students. Within-class ability grouping is an instructional strategy that has received attention for its potential benefits to students. The authors assessed the effects of within-class ability grouping on kindergarten reading growth by using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort. Results revealed that the frequency with which teachers used ability groups was positively associated with mean school gain in reading, suggesting that early literacy and reading improvement in kindergarten may be facilitated by the use of ability groups in reading.

The conceptual approach included individual, family, and school characteristics believed to influence educational performance and outcomes with emphasis was given to variables for with evidence of differential effects for males and females. Using the nationally representative, longitudinal NELS-88 data set, a logistic regression model examined the extent to which individual, family, and school characteristics were differentially associated (for male and female students) with identification for special education. The model identified a variety of characteristics associated with identification for special education, but only one individual characteristic, self-concept, for which the effect was different for male and female students. Recommendations for secondary education and transition practices and research were offered related to self-concept with respect to differences across gender, racial/ethnic, and disability status.

C2  - We surveyed a national sample of 139 school psychology students to better understand their perceptions of their practicum experiences. Specifically, we examined the students' reports of the types of activities in which they engage during practicum experiences and their perceptions of their school-based supervisors' activities. This information is potentially important as school psychology engages in a paradigm shift. Although most school psychology programs may teach students the proposed new and expanded roles, it is unclear whether field-based experiences are congruent with such university-based training. Results indicate that students spent the majority of their practicum time in assessment-related activities. They were generally satisfied with their practicum experience and supervisor, although many knew little about the range of their supervisor's activities. Most field-based practicum supervisors appeared to provide limited modeling of new and expanded roles. (Contains 5 tables.)

Data collection focused on the students' interactions with peers and adults in general education and special education settings. The data and discussion raises questions regarding inclusive education. The majority of students had more overall interactions with peers in their special education settings. The students also had more interactions with adults and initiated more interactions with adults in special education settings than general education settings.

C2  - A random sample of primary-grade teachers from across the United States was surveyed about within-class ability grouping in reading. Sixty-three percent of participants reported using within-class ability groups. Groups are smaller and more flexible than those formed in the past, with teachers emphasizing teaching comprehension, reading vocabulary, and other basic reading skills to each of their groups. Most teachers reported that they used within-class ability grouping because it helps them meet their students' instructional needs, although there were some reasons for concern. For instance, students in lower ability groups spend more time involved in noninstructional activities, are less likely to be asked critical comprehension questions, and are given fewer opportunities to select their own reading material.

C2  - Spearman's ''Law of Diminishing Returns'' with regard to ability is tested in a dataset from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. The dataset consisted of a sample of 6980 children aged 12-16 from the 1997 cohort. The subjects were tested with a computer administrated adaptive format of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery consisting of 12 subtests. Spearman's ''Law of Diminishing Returns'' was tested by two methods both dividing the sample into Low/High ability based either on the total score on the test or on the score one of the 12 subtests. Subsequently the ability groups were factor analysed separately. The eigenvalue of the first principal component and the first principal axis factor, and the average inter-correlation of the subtests were used as estimates of the g saturation and compared across groups. The study could not confirm Spearman's ''Law of Diminishing Returns'' for any of the methods applied and did not find any relevant differences across methods applied.

AB  -  The current study investigated the impact of implementing Instructional Consultation Teams (IC Teams) on the disproportionate referral and placement of minority students into special education. Data were collected on referral and placement patterns of minority students in 13 IC Teams schools and 9 comparison schools. Three accepted indices of disproportionality—including risk indexes, odds ratios, and composition indexes—were calculated and analyzed for the baseline and for 2 years of project implementation. After 2 years of implementation, there were significant decreases in the risk of minority students in IC Team project schools being referred to and placed in special education when compared to nonproject schools. Moreover, the odds of minority students' being referred and placed in special education decreased by almost half in IC Team schools. Similar decreases in IC Team schools were noted when analyzing the composition indexes. The current findings also highlight the influence that quality classroom instructional practices have on the referral and placement of minority students for special education services.

C2  - Oppositely valenced forces may be at work to influence rates of placement of children into mental retardation programs. On one hand, educational policies regarding intellectual disability and concerns about overrepresentation of minorities in special education may contribute to lower placement rates; on the other hand, more difficult intelligence test norms may be a countervailing force, increasing placement rates. An analysis of longitudinal data on state and national level placement rates reveals that a lengthy and steep 12-year decline in students receiving mental retardation services reversed shortly after the introduction of the WISC-III in 1991. This phenomenon has relevance for death-penalty cases, because this historical pattern may affect the ability to establish whether an adult meets the developmental period onset criterion for mental retardation.

C2  - This study investigated the role of an early educational intervention and child-, family-, peer-, and school-level predictors on court-reported juvenile delinquency. Data were provided from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, an ongoing investigation of the scholastic and social development of more than 1,500 low-income youths (93% of whom were African American). Preschool intervention was associated with reductions in the incidence, frequency, and severity of juvenile delinquency by age 18. Childhood classroom adjustment, special education placement for an emotional or behavioral disorder, and school mobility were also predictive of delinquency outcomes, as were gender and family and environmental risk status. Findings demonstrate the importance of early intervention and schooling factors in reducing delinquency and highlight the benefits of early intervention as one mechanism for delinquency prevention.

C2  - This paper reports on a cross-disciplinary study by an L1 compositionist and an applied linguist investigating interrelationships among university basic writing students' responses to linguistic identity labels, their residency statuses, and their preferences for mainstream or multilingual composition. Previous L2 writing research has suggested predictive links among these factors, but little research has examined such links in a diverse multilingual student population. Data for this study come from interviews with nine students of varying residency statuses (U.S.-born, U.S.-resident immigrant, and international) who had completed either a mainstream or a multilingual section of basic writing and a subsequent mainstream first-year composition (FYC) course. The authors found that the students across the three residency groups understood identity labels primarily in relation to strong or weak language ability, although they varied in their definitions of some of these labels. In addition, no consistent pattern emerged as to which residency group affiliated with which labels. Nor were students' label affiliations clearly linked to their preferences for a mainstream or multilingual composition course. Students from both class sections, however, expressed that they preferred their section because it addressed their language abilities and had students who were "like" them. The authors consider implications of their findings for multilingual and mainstream writing program placement and curriculum practices.

C2  - This study examined a focused remediation and enrichment effort among school and university faculty to affect the mathematics achievement of a group of third-grade students in a Title I elementary school. A total of 87 students participated in the Code RED (Remediation and Enrichment Days) Project. During the Code RED Project, student assessment data were used to identify high-need areas for mathematics instruction. The Code RED Project sessions occurred in small groups over a 10-week period. Pre- and posttest assessments, as well as state-standardized tests, were used for data gathering during the project. Pre- and posttest data indicate that students made significant gains in mathematics achievement during the Code RED Project overall, in different ability groups, and in different subgroup populations. In addition, during the Code RED Project, 100% of the third-grade class passed the end-of-grade state-standardized testing. A comparison of the pass rates for the state-standardized test for third-grade students before and during the Code RED Project indicates a significant increase in students labeled in the pass-proficient and pass-advanced categories. In addition to the students' increasing their achievement results, teachers adopted new instructional practices, and preservice teachers participated in the inquiry culture of the school.

Information is provided about the district's efforts across 5 years, and data are provided across those 5 and 2 years of follow-up. Data indicate that the systemic change efforts at multiple levels (i.e., district, school, education team) and across constituencies (e.g., parents, district and school administrators, instructional and support personnel) have resulted in changes in placement for students with disabilities, emphasizing both placement in their neighborhood schools or schools of choice and access to general education settings. In addition, these changes occurred in a climate of high-stakes assessment, with the state department of education initiating a practice of publicly grading both schools and districts based on the performance of students on state assessments. Although the district is still engaged in change efforts, the study describes lessons learned and provides recommendations for other school districts attempting such change efforts. The data reflected in this analysis, however, convince the district that change is occurring, that change is spreading across the district, and that change is sustainable in spite of changes in district leadership and key personnel.

Systems of care are spectrums of services organized to meet the needs facing youth with serious emotional and behavioral difficulties. This study examined the relationship between school involvement in the Dawn Project and outcomes for participating youth. This was done by determining whether school contact with the service coordinator and school involvement with the child and family team had an impact on educational placement restrictiveness. Findings indicate that age, ethnicity, and gender are significant predictors of educational placement restrictiveness. There is also evidence to suggest that school involvement may be associated with more restrictive educational placements.

C2  - Brantmeier [Brantmeier, C., 2006. "Advanced L2 learners and reading placement: self-assessment, computer-based testing, and subsequent performance." 'System 34" (1), 15-35] found that self-assessment (SA) of second language (L2) reading ability is not an accurate predictor for computer-based testing or subsequent classroom performance. With 359 advanced L2 university-level learners, the present study attempts to provide new empirical evidence concerning the use of SA, when measured via criterion-referenced items, as a predictor of reading scores on a computer-based placement test and subsequent reading achievement. Before reading, participants completed a contextualized, criterion-referenced instrument for SA that was created from the European Language Portfolio. A four-item contextualized SA questionnaire was also completed after reading. Participants completed the following: self-assessment questionnaire taken prior to computer-based test, computer-based test of 8 readings, 2 in-class readings, written recall, multiple-choice, topic familiarity questionnaire, and post-reading SA questionnaire. Findings indicated that a descriptive and criterion-referenced questionnaire for SA may be a reliable predictor of both reading scores on a computer-based test and subsequent classroom performance when comprehension is measured via sentence completion and multiple choice items. The criterion-referenced questionnaire did not prove to be a reliable predictor of reading comprehension with the written recall task for the short story. The post-reading SA instrument proved reliable for all three comprehension tasks. Results hold important implications for both language placement directors and test constructors.

C2  - One of the most serious problems plaguing in the field of gifted education is the need for the development of appropriate programs and identification procedures for gifted and talented students from different culturally and diverse backgrounds. Therefore, there has been increased attention and efforts devoted to the academic needs of gifted and talented children from different culturally and diverse backgrounds. One impediment to good teacher judgment about gifted and talented but culturally different students may very well be negative teacher attitudes toward children from diverse cultural backgrounds. Social class may also serve as a basis for stereotyping and several investigations have documented the negative stereotypes which portray lower-class students. In a study that investigated the role of the student socioeconomic status (SES) and teacher efficacy in the special education referral decisions, it was found that student SES and teacher efficacy interact in their influence on special education referral decision. Additionally, children described as low SES were more likely to be referred for restrictive placements in special education programs than their peers who described as high SES in the case study. It is apparent from the review of the relevant literature that SES was a significant factor that affects teachers' educational decision making. Additionally, previous research studies which examined the role of socioeconomic in gifted education were limited to relationships data. No empirical study has been found that investigated the effect of the child's SES on teachers' referral and recommendation for placement in the gifted and talented program. Therefore, the particular focus of this study is to examine the effect of SES on teachers' eligibility decisions in the gifted and talented program. More specifically, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the student's SES on teachers' referral and recommendation for placement in the gifted and talented program.

AB  - In this article, Jacob Hibel, Susan Faircloth, and George Farkas investigate the persistent finding that American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students are overrepresented in special education. Using data from the kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, the authors compare the third-grade special education placement rate of AI/AN students to that of other racial/ethnic groups. They find that approximately 15 percent of AI/AN third-graders received special education services, a rate far higher than that of the other racial and ethnic groups. However,using multilevel regression analysis to control for a number of confounding factors,including socioeconomic status and test scores at school entry, they find no statistically significant difference between the special education placement rates of AI/AN and non-Hispanic white students. Controlling for a range of school characteristics,they also find that schools with a higher proportion of AI/AN students place these students in special education at rates similar to those of other schools in the United States. The authors conclude that the strongest predictor of special education placement is a student's academic readiness on entering kindergarten as measured by the student's pre-reading and pre-mathematics scores. They discuss the implications of these findings for future research and practice in the education of AI/AN students.

C2  - This paper investigates the placement of students at an urban Ohio college campus in developmental mathematics and Intermediate Algebra courses. We have found that the ACT Mathematics and COMPASS Domain I (Algebra) Placement scores both correlate well with success in the Intermediate Algebra course and that, although females have lower placement test scores than males, they have a higher success rate in the course. We determined that the existing cutoff for placement in the Intermediate Algebra course is accurate in predicting students to be more likely to succeed than fail the Intermediate Algebra course at this institution.

Focusing on California, the authors examine the assumptions that underlie these assessments and policies. They argue that the policies signal different conceptions (and misconceptions) about the nature of bilingualism and the needs of U.S.-educated language minority students pursuing academic goals.

C2  - Many colleges and university's use SAT math scores or math placement tests to place students in the appropriate math course. This study compares the use of math placement scores and SAT scores for 188 freshman students. The student's grades and faculty observations were analyzed to determine if the SAT scores and/or college math assessment scores are better or equivalent indicators of the proper math level at which students should be enrolled in the first year. The data revealed that the SAT scores were not the best indicators of the math level course the student should select, and that the college math assessment scores may have been better indicators according to initial midterm   grades.

C2  - Originally described by Leo Kanner (1943) and recognized as a special education eligibility category by the U.S. Department of Education in 1990 (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA], 1990), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by deficits in reciprocal social interactions, communication, and interests and behaviors. Even though individual prevalence rates vary by state, published prevalence rate estimates are approximately one out of 150 children, making ASD the most common development disability diagnosed in children. The issue of ethnic disproportionality in children with ASD has important implications for diagnosis and provision of intervention since prognosis for children with ASD improves with early identification. However, previous investigations of ethnicity and ASD have indicated that parents from different cultures have varying points of view regarding ASD symptomology, often leading to a later diagnosis. Given contradictory evidence regarding ethnic representation among individuals with ASD, and the recognition that ethnicity may have an influence on rate of identification as well as subsequent special education placement, this study investigated the characteristics of a sample of children with ASD in Georgia, the classrooms within which they are placed, and the demographics of their teachers. Ethnicity of the child and teacher as well as educational setting were specific variables under investigation. (Contains 3 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - ABSTRACTThis article investigates the practice of heterogeneous grouping for reading and literacy instruction through a detailed interactional analysis focused on the least proficient readers in two mixed‐ability group contexts. The resulting analysis suggests that struggling readers in heterogeneous groups may encounter the same problems often associated with their placement in homogeneous ability groups. The mixed‐ability groups examined in this study were characterized by pervasive interactional differentiation, which for some students may lead to the kind of stigmatizing effects thought to result from long‐term participation in low‐ability groups. In addition, the low‐ability students in these heterogeneous groups read less and were interrupted more often than the other students—two differences in the treatment of low‐ability students that have also been associated with homogeneous ability grouping. The study thus points to the difficulty that teachers face in promoting simultaneous reading development among multiple proficiency levels. It also suggests the need for renewed research efforts focused on current instructional alternatives to traditional ability groups, as well as the experience of struggling readers within them.تتقصى هذه المقالة ممارسة جمع طلاب ذوي مستوات متفاوتة لتعلم القراءة والكتابة من خلال تحليل دقيق تفاعلي مركّز على القراء أقلّ كفاءة في سياق مجموعتين مختلفتي الإمكانيات. ويشير تحليل الناتج إلى أن القراء الضعفاء في مجموعات ذات مستوات متنوعة قد يواجهون نفس المشاكل التي غالباً تنوط بوضعهم في مجموعات ذات الإمكانيات الموحدة. وكانت المجموعات ذات الإمكانيات المختلفة التي فحصت في هذه الدراسة تتسم بالتمايز التفاعلي العميم الذي سيؤدي لبعض الطلاب إلى نوع من تأثيرات الوصم الذي من المعتقد أنها تترتب على اشتراك على المدى البعيد في مجموعات ذات المستوى المنخفض. وبالإضافة إلى ذلك الطلاب ذوو القدرة المنخفضة في هذه المجموعات المختلفة المستويات يقرؤون أقلّ ويتقاطعون أكثر من الطلاب الآخرين وهذان الفرقان في علاج الطلاب المنخفضي القدرة هما اللذان كانا قد ارتبطا بالمجموعة الموحدة المستوى في السابق. لذا تدل هذه الدراسة على الصعوبة التي يواجهها الأساتذة في تشجيع تطوير القراءة المتزامنة بين مستويات متفاوتة الإمكانيات ويشير كذلك إلى الحاجة لتجديد الجهود في القيام بأبحاث مركزة على بدائل تعليمية حديثة لمجموعات ذات القدرة التقليدية وتجربة القراء الضعفاء فيها كذلك.本文就最不熟练的阅读者在两个混合能力分组学习情况下，通过详细的互动分析，探究有关异质分组读写教育的实践。分析结果显示,有阅读困难的学生在混合能力组会遇到的困难，跟他们被编入同等能力组时所遇到的相同。本研究考查的两个混合能力组弥漫著互动差异的特性，可能对有些学生导致那种被认为长期参与低能力组所带来的轻蔑效应。此外，在该两个混合能力组的能力低学生，比其他学生所阅读的较少，被中断的机会较多  能力低学生所遭受到的这两种待遇差异，亦跟同等能力分组学习有关联。本研究因而指出教师在促进熟练程度参差的学生的同步阅读能力发展时所面对的困难。本文亦建议有需要重新研究有关现时通用而有别于传统能力分组的教学方法，以及有关有阅读困难的学生的亲身经历。Cet article examine la pratique des groupes hétérogènes dans l'enseignement de la lecture et du littérisme au moyen d'une analyse précise des interactions centrée sur les élèves les moins performants dans deux contextes de groupes de niveau mixte. L'analyse des résultats suggère que les lecteurs en difficulté dans les groupes hétérogènes peuvent rencontrer le même problème que celui qu'ils rencontrent souvent dans les groupes de niveau homogène. Les groupes de niveau mixte qui ont été examinés dans cette étude se caractérisent par une différenciation discrète des interactions, qui peut conduire certains élèves à un genre d'effets de stigmatisation considéré comme résultant d'une participation durable à des groupes de niveau homogène. De plus, les élèves de niveau faible dans ces groupes hétérogènes lisent moins et sont interrompus plus souvent que les autres élèves—deux différences dans le traitement des élèves faibles que l'on retrouve également quand le groupement est homogène. Cette étude met donc le doigt sur les difficultés que rencontrent les enseignants à promouvoir simultanément les progrès en lecture d'élèves de niveaux différents. Il suggère également la nécessité des efforts à faire pour effectuer de nouvelles recherches centrées sur les alternatives pédagogiques actuelles aux traditionnels groupes de niveau, ainsi qu'à ce qui se passe alors dans ce cadre pour les lecteurs en difficulté.Практика обучения чтению и словесности в группах, объединяющих испытуемых разного уровня и способностей, исследуется в данной статье посредством детального анализа взаимодействия, в основном, наименее опытных читателей в двух гетерогенных группах. Полученные результаты свидетельствуют о том, что в гетерогенных группах слабые читатели могут столкнуться с проблемами, которые часто возникают у них при работе в гомогенных группах, со сверстниками сходных умений и способностей. В группах смешанных способностей, исследованных авторами, проявляются значительные признаки выборочности и предпочтений в общении, которые ставят на некоторых учащихся «клеймо неудачника», что раньше наблюдалось при их продолжительном обучении в гомогенных группах, среди детей со слабыми способностями. Кроме того, в гетерогенных группах слабые ученики меньше читают и их чаще прерывают, чем остальных учащихся. Подобные проблемы ранее также связывались с работой среди учащихся одного уровня способностей. Таким образом, данное исследование указывает на трудности, с которыми сталкиваются учителя, одновременно обучающие чтению учащихся разного уровня. Полученные результаты также указывают на необходимость возобновить усилия по поиску альтернатив для традиционных одноуровневых групп и глубже исследовать опыт слабых учащихся при обучении в группах.Este artículo investiga la costumbre de tener grupos heterogéneos en la enseñanza de lectura y alfabetización por medio de un análisis interaccional detallado enfocado en los lectores menos hábiles en el contexto de dos grupos de habilidades mixtas. El análisis resultante sugiere que los lectores menos hábiles en los grupos heterogéneos pueden toparse con los mismos problemas generalmente asociados con su colocación en grupos de habilidades homogéneas. Los grupos de habilidades mixtas examinados en este estudio se caracterizaban por una diferenciación interaccional penetrante, que podría crear en algunos estudiantes el tipo de efectos estigmatizantes que se creen ser el resultado de la participación por mucho tiempo en grupos de baja habilidad. Además, los estudiantes menos hábiles en estos grupos heterogéneos leían menos y eran interrumpidos más a menudo que otros estudiantes—dos diferencias en el trato de estudiantes de baja habilidad que también han sido asociadas con el agrupamiento de estudiantes de habilidades homogéneas. Por lo tanto, el estudio señala la dificultad que los maestros enfrentan al promover el desarrollo simultáneo de la lectura en estudiantes de múltiples niveles de habilidad. También sugiere la necesidad de renovar los esfuerzos de hacer investigación que se enfoque en alternativas a las prácticas corrientes de enseñanza en grupos tradicionales basados en las habilidades, al igual que en la experiencia propia de los estudiantes de bajas habilidades en ellos.

AB  -  A kindergartner’s opportunities to develop reading and language arts skills are constrained by the amount of time allocated to reading instruction. In the meantime, the student’s engagement in learning tasks may increase if the instruction has been adapted to his or her prior ability through homogeneous grouping. This study investigates whether the grouping effects on kindergartners’ reading growth depend on the amount of reading instruction time and the intensity of grouping. To answer the study’s research questions requires causal inferences about concurrent multivalued instructional treatments. The authors develop a procedure of applying the method of marginal mean weighting through stratification to multilevel educational data. Results from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten cohort data set lend support to the theoretical hypothesis that when teachers allocate a substantial amount of time to reading instruction, homogeneous grouping helps kindergartners to gain more in reading. The authors find no effect of homogeneous grouping when the total amount of reading time is limited. They also find that the benefit of increasing reading instruction time becomes evident only if kindergarten teachers adapt instruction through homogeneous grouping.

C2  - The scholarship about assessment for placement is extensive and notoriously ambiguous. Foremost among the questions that continue to be unresolved in this scholarship is this one: Is a writing sample necessary for "accurate placement"? Using a robust data sample of student assessment essays and ACCUPLACER test scores, we put this question to the test. For practical, theoretical, and conceptual reasons, our conclusion is that a writing sample is not necessary for "accurate placement." Furthermore our work on this project has shown us that the concept of accurate placement itself is slippery and problematic. (Contains 3 figures.)

C2  - The study examines the effects of classroom achievement grouping (AG) practices on the early mathematics performance of language-minority students and compares their mathematics achievement to that of English-speaking majority students. Using a nationally representative database of the USA, both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were done. In the cross-sectional analyses we explored the direct effect of grouping practice on students performance, while in the longitudinal analysis we looked at the growth trajectory in mathematics learning. The results of cross-sectional analyses indicated that the effect of AG was negative on the math achievement in 1st and 5th graders. The longitudinal analysis showed a significant negative effect of AG for English Language Learners (ELL). The paper provides the basis for practical guidelines for the grouping practices in mathematics. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

Using propensity score matching and data from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors estimate the effect of ESL placement on immigrant achievement. In schools with more immigrant students, the authors find that ESL placement results in higher levels of academic performance; in schools with few immigrant students, the effect reverses. This is not to suggest a one-size-fits-all policy; many immigrant students, regardless of school composition, generational status, or ESL placement, struggle to achieve at levels sufficient for acceptance to a 4-year university. This study offers several factors to be taken into consideration as schools develop policies and practices to provide immigrant students opportunities to learn.

C2  - This study examines the impact of ability grouping practices on the achievement gains among African Americans and Hispanics during elementary school. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, the results strongly support the differential effects hypothesis of ability grouping. That is, students who are lower grouped for reading instruction learn substantially less, and higher-grouped students learn slightly more over the first few years of school, compared to students who are in classrooms that do not practice grouping. Overall, the results of our study call into question the notion that ability grouping is a beneficial practice in the earliest years of schooling. (Contains 3 tables and 10 notes.)

C2  - Each year , thousands graduate high school academically underprepared for college. Many must take remedial or developmental postsecondary coursework, and there is a growing debate about the effectiveness of such programs. This paper examines the effects of remediation using a unique data set of over 28,000 students. To account for selection biases, the paper implements an instrumental variables strategy based on variation in placement policies and the importance of proximity in college choice. The results suggest that students in remediation are more likely to persist in college in comparison to students with similar backgrounds who were not required to take the courses.

AB  -  Waco Independent School District (WISD) initiated a project offering AP Spanish Language to Hispanic students in the eighth grade. The Hispanic students in this AP Spanish Language class and a similar comparison group answered survey questions on parental involvement, composition of peer group, sense of belonging at school, academic attitudes, and academic aspirations. Data gathered indicated that the students enrolled in the AP course made friends with peers who cared more about grades, enjoyed reading in English, and were more optimistic about their future family, future job, and their service to the community. These results suggest that Spanish-speaking skills can be viewed as a strength and can be used as a gateway, rather than a barrier, to academic success. Enrolling at-risk native Spanish-speaking students in an AP Spanish Language class during their eighth-grade year can create a peer group that honors the students’ native language. This academically supportive peer group can play a role in students’ decisions to enroll in higher level coursework in high school. Because beliefs about self and school are deep rooted and peer group influences are intensifying during middle school, the academic benefits of AP participation need to be extended to Spanish-speaking Hispanic students. AP Spanish Language programs such as this seems to be a feasible way to target Hispanic middle school students and create an academically supportive peer group that will positively influence students’ educational aspirations.

Fifty-eight Hispanic students in the AP class and a similar comparison group answered survey questions on parental involvement, peers, sense of belonging at school, and academic aspirations. Data gathered indicate that the AP students are more optimistic about their future and make friends who care more about grades. These students were more likely to enroll in advanced courses in 9th grade. Results suggest that Spanish-speaking skills can be viewed as a strength and as a gateway to academic success.

AB  -  English as a second language (ESL) is meant to provide a meaningful education for students learning English (ELLs); however, its effects remain largely unexplored. Using longitudinal, nationally representative data from the Educational Longitudinal Study, the authors estimate the effects of ESL placement on language minority (LM) adolescents’ college preparation and academic achievement. Findings indicate that LM students who most closely fit the EL profile (recent immigrant, relatively low English proficiency) experience positive math outcomes and null effects in other academic areas; however, LM students who fit this profile less well experience negative effects. Results suggest that although ESL placement may benefit students most in need and for a limited time after arrival, considerable caution is advised in students’ placement and retention in ESL.

AB  - Background This investigation was sparked by research findings on secondary education showing school segregation to be closely associated with homogeneous grouping practices, such as tracking and between-class ability grouping. Research Design We conduct secondary analyses of national data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). Objectives Using these data, we investigate the degree to which the racial and ethnic composition of schools is associated with use of ability grouping practices as early as kindergarten. We focus on within-class ability grouping for reading instruction because it is the most common form of homogeneous grouping for the early grades. Results and Conclusions We find that this form of grouping is practiced by a majority of kindergarten teachers and schools, although frequency of use is quite varied, and some teachers and schools use it only sporadically. The most intensive use of within-class ability grouping exists in schools that serve high proportions of minority students and in schools with high variability in students’ reading readiness. The association between student body composition and use of this instructional practice remains even after variability in student academic skills and other structural characteristics of schools are accounted for. Schools serving primarily minority students that use within-class ability grouping have higher average gains in reading achievement by the end of the school year than comparable schools that do not use this form of grouping. Use of this instructional practice is not associated with increases in average achievement gain scores for schools serving students of diverse or primarily White backgrounds. Our findings provide the foundation for further studies of the structural, cultural, and political features of schools associated with the use of ability grouping at the onset of schooling.

AB  -  The transition to high school is a critical stage in students’ academic trajectories and can be especially difficult for middle school students who struggle academically. Starting high school on a low academic track and with low academic performance often leads to dropping out of high school. This study investigates what might protect academically vulnerable students during the transition to high school by exploring the potential effects social relationships and changing context have on academic outcomes in high school. As students move from middle school to high school, their social relationships are transformed. The degree to which social relationships change is in part a function of the way school districts are organized. The results suggest that middle school social relationships are protective against low academic outcomes in the first year of high school, but not for low-achieving middle school students. In addition, a district context characterized by greater reconfiguration of peer social relationships is not associated with math course placement but protects against course failure, especially among low-achieving middle school students. These results suggest implications for the way districts organize students and how contexts of school transitions have the potential to provide resilience.

AB  -  Studies have documented a strong relationship between low birth-weight status and adverse child outcomes such as poor school performance and need for special education services. Following a cohort of more than 1,300 low-income and predominately African American children in the Chicago Longitudinal Study, the authors investigate whether birth weight and family socioeconomic risk measured at the time of the child’s birth predicts placement into special education classes or grade retention in elementary school. Contrary to previous research, the authors find that low birth weight (<5.5 pounds) does not predict special education placement. Rather, these children (especially boys) are more likely to be retained in grade as an alternative approach in addressing poor school performance. Family socioeconomic risk at birth is a significant predictor of the need for remedial services. The authors also assess whether a high-quality preschool program offered at the ages between 3 and 4 can reduce the negative effects of low family socioeconomic status and birth weight on the need for special education and grade retention. Preschool participation in the Child—Parent Centers is found to reduce the likelihood of school remediation. The effects of preschool are greater for children from families with higher levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. The beneficial effects of preschool on special education placement are also larger for boys than for girls.

C2  - This study was born from the idea that valid comparison research can be conducted with students who are placed into and exempt from required developmental reading courses and that these groups do contain students with similar reading ability. This overlooked population consists of students with placement test scores that hover tightly on either side of pass or fail. Using the Standard Error of Measurement ("SEM") of the reading "COMPASS"[TM] placement test to identify two groups with statistically similar reading ability, this study investigates the persistence of a select group of students who just narrowly placed into or out of the highest level required developmental reading course in one community college system. These students have statistically similar reading placement scores but very different paths taken in relation to the requirement of developmental reading education. Initially, two groups emerged: those who were exempt from developmental reading education because their score fell on the passing side of the "SEM" and those who did take developmental reading education because their score fell on the failing side of the "SEM." Ultimately, three statistically similar groups were identified: those completing, those not completing, and those exempt from a required developmental reading course. The results of a binary logistic regression analysis showed that group membership was a statistically significant predictor of persistence. All groups began with theoretically the same reading skill level, based on the "SEM," yet group membership in relation to successful completion of a required developmental reading course was associated with a statistically significant greater likelihood of persisting in college over the course of 10 terms.

A total of 32 students in three classes participated. Before the study began, an independent group‐oriented reward program was being applied (i.e., a student received access to a tangible reward after passing each AR comprehension test). This program was supplemented with an interdependent group‐oriented contingency, and results showed that the number of quizzes passed per week increased immediately after the intervention was applied; however, this increase was not maintained. When students were divided into ability groups based on their average baseline performance, the lowest performing students exhibited a statistically significant increase in quiz performance (i.e., quizzes taken, quizzes passed, and book level), but no significant changes were found in the average and high performing groups. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

C2  - By incorporating two theoretical frameworks this study examines how school characteristics shape first-grade reading ability-grouping practices, and how this, in turn, affects students' reading achievement. The author uses the data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study and applies the propensity-score method to examine whether first-grade ability grouping improves student achievement, whether ability grouping increases achievement inequalities, and whether its effects vary by student initial abilities and/or school contexts. Findings support an argument that ability grouping is an organizational response to problems of diversity in the student body. Schools that use ability grouping are likely to have heterogeneous ability compositions. They are also public, low-performing, low socioeconomic status, and high-minority schools. In these schools, ability grouping has no effects or negative effects, particularly for low-ability students. In contrast, ability grouping may improve achievement for all students in schools with advantageous characteristics, mostly private schools, and may reduce achievement inequalities, because low-ability students benefit the most from this practice.

The results of the qualitative study can be interpreted to conclude that students rarely were engaged in transition planning, and when they were engaged, it came too late in their high school careers. Students with disabilities and their parents described dissatisfaction in the following areas: inadequate communication from school staff, frustration with assumptions made about the student, funneling of the student into traditional adult service programs, and a lack of accountability from the schools. Even those students who reported being engaged in the transition process experienced inadequate transition planning. Strategies to improve transition planning are presented.

C2  - The rising incidence of autism and placement in general education necessitates a greater understanding of the impact of educational placement on academic achievement for adolescents with autism. In the present study, the academic profiles of adolescents with autism who have been educated in inclusive and self-contained settings are described using three measures: cognitive assessments, adaptive behavior, and academic achievement. Findings indicate significant between group differences (inclusion versus self-contained) in academic achievement measures. However, there were no significant differences in intelligence or adaptive behavior assessment scores for those adolescents education. Students who were included in general education obtained significantly higher scores on tests of achievement, including subtests measuring abstract and inferential skills; however, all students demonstrated emerging academic skills on standardized measures. The importance of academic inclusion for adolescents with autism is described. (Contains 2 tables.)

C2  - This article uses a school finance equity framework to examine the distribution of resources across the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) during a policy shift toward neighborhood-based student assignment between 1999 and 2004. Findings from this analysis confirm that MNPS schools are resegregating. Additionally, this study finds that, although Nashville students from poor and minority backgrounds received additional resources from the district in the form of reduced pupil/teacher ratios, they faced challenges in the form of higher percentages of inexperienced teachers and reduced average teacher salaries. Finally, this analysis provides evidence to suggest that these inequitable relationships worsen slightly over time. (Contains 9 tables, 5 figures, and 6 notes.)

AB  -  Given the efforts of comprehensive school reform to improve the quality of educational opportunities for students by providing a standards based curriculum, this analysis examines the issue of tracking and its implications regarding curriculum differentiation. Using data from middle schools involved with the comprehensive school reform model, America’s Choice, this mixed method analysis shows a complex manifestation of curriculum differentiation where schools had multiple types of academic tracks that responded to students differences including comprehensive learning groups, subject-specific groups, and temporary learning groups used for test preparation. Although school-level reports indicated that most regular education and gifted students were exposed to the America’s Choice English Language Arts and mathematics units, special education students and English Language learners were least likely to gain access to this content. Individual teacher responses to tracking were idiosyncratic where some modified the curriculum and instructional pace by learning group ultimately impacting the amount of content exposure where those in the top learning groups were able to cover greater material than those in lower groups. Even though some teachers resisted tracking by addressing the classroom issues that caused differences in curriculum and instruction, tracking persisted as an entrenched practice in these middle schools through preexisting academic groups and were also replicated in new learning groups that emerged to address student academic needs related to state testing demands.

Results showed a moderately strong correlation between teachers' judgments and students' performance across all of the students, which is consistent with past research. Teachers' judgments, however, consistently and significantly overestimated the actual performance of students, particularly those who were typically performing students.

C1  - Academically Gifted, Referral, Gender Bias, Teaching Methods, Gender Differences, Teacher Attitudes, Student Placement, Profiles, Vignettes, Student Characteristics
C2  - The goal of this mixed-methods study was to explore the effect of gender on teachers' willingness to refer students to a gifted and talented program. Teachers (N = 28) were provided with one of two profiles (i.e., female or male) describing a gifted student. Results indicated that teachers' decisions for referral to gifted programs were significantly influenced by the student's gender; teachers were much less willing to refer a female student than an identically described male student to gifted programs. Further, qualitative analysis revealed that teachers' descriptions of students and reasons for their referral decisions differed considerably based on the student's gender. Responses illustrated gender bias in teachers' perceptions, expectations, and beliefs about the profiled students. Implications for practice are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 1 footnote.)

AB  -  This study explored the extent of disproportionality in the identification and placement of culturally and linguistically diverse students identified as English language learners in special education. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses examined patterns and predictors of identification and placement in special education among English learners throughout the state relative to their White peers. The results indicate that these students are increasingly likely to be identified as having learning disabilities or mental retardation, and are less likely to be served in either the least or most restrictive educational environments relative to their White peers. The author also examined the influence of several district-level factors commonly explored in studies of racial disproportionality and found that these factors did not evidence similar relationships to the disproportionate representation of English language learners. The study presents implications for further research and practice.

In this case study, IEP team decision-making is examined as a socially situated practice. Transcripts of an initial evaluation and IEP meeting and subsequent interviews with team members were analyzed in concert with the pertinent documents to understand the decision-making process and outcomes for a 5-year-old boy. The student's diagnosis, placement, and goal setting resulted in discussion and were pursued in postmeeting interviews. Further analysis was conducted regarding the proportion of interactions among participants. Results indicate that the turn-taking structure of the IEP meeting, the IEP template, and communication prior to the meeting influenced the decisions, and individual team members held opinions that they did not voice during the meeting.

This article draws attention to the importance of understanding the assignment mechanism in policy and program evaluation studies, and illustrates how information collected through interviews can develop a richer understanding of the assignment mechanism. Focusing on the issue of student assignment to algebra in 8th grade, I show how a preliminary data collection effort aimed at understanding the assignment mechanism is particularly beneficial in multisite observational studies in education. The findings, based on ten interviews and administrative data from a large school district, draw attention to the often ignored heterogeneity in the assignment mechanism across schools. These findings likely extend beyond the current research project in question to related educational policy issues such as ability grouping, tracking, differential course taking, and curricular intensity, as well as other social programs in which the assignment mechanism can differ across sites.

AB  -  History is an important but often overlooked content area for all students in this current era of accountability. Yet instruction in history can help students become problem solvers and learn to make interpretations from multiple perspectives. This article reports the results of a pilot study examining history learning across three groups of students (i.e., students with disabilities, students without disabilities, and students enrolled in an honors class) as they studied history (a unit on Andrew Jackson) through a Web-based history learning environment—the Virtual History Museum. The results indicate students in all three ability groups made gains from pretest to posttest in factual knowledge and reasoning about key concepts of the unit. The results provide preliminary support that a Web-based learning environment that includes features to assist students with mild disabilities can improve learning for all students at about the same rate.

C2  - Recent &quot;math wars&quot; have drawn attention to how well various high school mathematics curricula prepare students for college-level mathematics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the high school mathematics curricula and students' post-secondary mathematics placement recommendation, specifically how students responded to the mathematics placement recommendations and the students' performance in the first college mathematics class. The results showed no relationship between students' participation in a particular high school mathematics curriculum and mathematics placement recommendation, or between student high school mathematics curriculum and students' responses to a university mathematics placement recommendation. However, students who took a more/less difficult class than what was recommended achieved significantly lower/higher grades than those who followed the recommendation. The findings have implications for high school mathematics curricula selection, post-secondary student placement, and future research in this area. (Contains 3 tables.)

Participants included 51 middle school and high school students receiving special education services under the ID (intellectual disabilities) category, along with 12 special education teachers. Student and teacher report were utilized in making comparisons between students in "self-contained" classrooms and "resource" classrooms. Results indicate less dependency and greater feelings of self-determination for students in resource rooms. Practical recommendations for improving student outcomes and relationships for students in self-contained classrooms are discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  -  In 1997, Chicago implemented a policy that required algebra for all ninth-grade students, eliminating all remedial coursework. This policy increased opportunities to take algebra for low-skill students who had previously enrolled in remedial math. However, little is known about how schools respond to the policy in terms of organizing math classrooms to accommodate curricular changes. The policy unintentionally affected high-skill students who were not targeted by the policy—those who would enroll in algebra in its absence. Using an interrupted time-series design combined with within-cohort comparisons, this study shows that schools created more mixed-ability classrooms when eliminating remedial math classes, and peer skill levels declined for high-skill students. Consequently, their test scores also declined.

C2  - The authors analyzed the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) national data set to investigate gender differences in ability group placement in American kindergartens. They found that in kindergarten, within-class ability grouping was widely used for reading instruction, with boys being underrepresented in high-achieving reading groups and overrepresented in low-achieving ones. Gender differences in reading group placement were consistent across classrooms and were explained by student-level characteristics. Boys' underrepresentation in high reading groups was explained by their lower reading skills at kindergarten entry, as measured by the reading test scores available in the ECLS-K. By contrast, boys' overrepresentation in low reading groups was only partially explained by their lower test scores. Compared with girls of similar social background and reading test scores, boys continued to have higher chances of placement into a low reading group. This remaining gender difference was explained by the lower teacher evaluations of boys' reading skills and approaches to learning. Boys' disadvantages in reading group placement at school entry raise concern over their further academic success. (Contains 3 tables, 1 figure and 3 notes.)

AB  -  The first college mathematics course a student enrolls in is often affected by performance on a college mathematics placement test. Yet validity evidence of mathematics placement tests remains limited, even for nationally standardized placement tests, and when it is available usually consists of examining a student’s subsequent performance in mathematics courses. This study expands on existing literature by considering whether a nationally standardized college mathematics placement test (ACCUPLACER) contributes to the prediction of enrollment and success in developmental and nondevelopmental mathematics courses above and beyond prediction associated with the ACT mathematics test. Results for a sample of more than 1,300 students from 20 postsecondary institutions suggest that ACCUPLACER does not contribute to either the prediction of enrollment or subsequent success in such courses, and that comparable information is provided by using the ACT mathematics score alone. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Background/Context Over the last ten years, a convergence of laws and decrees has impacted the development and implementation of Arizona's current program for English language learners (ELLs): the four-hour Structured English Immersion (SEI) model. Arizona's new model, while being touted by some as the most effective program for ELLs (Clark, 2009), is raising concerns with researchers and educators involved with the education of ELLs. A recent Auditor General's report (Davenport, 2011) indicates that instructional programs for ELLs have lacked uniformity and that the impact of the SEI model on ELLs’ language development and academic achievement is unknown. Therefore, although it has been over a decade since the Flores Consent Order, we must continue to examine the evidence regarding implementation of the SEI model in order to determine if the instruction offered to ELLs is comparable in amount, scope, and quality to that provided to English-proficient students. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study This paper utilizes the trajectory of these language policies as a lens for examining how ideas stemming from the Flores Consent Order and the English-Only voter initiative (Proposition 203), and continuing through to the legislative response of the court order (House Bill 2064) are evidenced in Arizona's SEI classrooms. Research Design The purpose of this qualitative study is to document and describe the characteristics of the four-hour SEI policy in practice. Over a seven-week period during the spring semester of the 2009/2010 school year, researchers utilized ethnographic observation methods, interviews, and a collection of artifacts to document the implementation of the SEI model and instruction of ELLs. Using a constant comparison analysis, findings were re-examined to show how this restrictive language policy has impacted and shaped the SEI model in practice today. Conclusions/Recommendations Arizona's current four-hour model, as implemented in K-12 SEI classrooms, hinders policy intentions: ELLs do not have access to quality instruction, or a curriculum that is comparable in amount, scope, and quality to that of non-ELLs. Furthermore, deficiencies in funding abound, limiting ELLs’ opportunities for the compensatory education needed to help them catch up academically. The authors contend that a re-examination of the SEI policy is warranted if the state is to fully realize the intentions of the Flores Consent Order and equal educational opportunity for ELLs.

Using a constant comparison analysis, findings were re-examined to show how this restrictive language policy has impacted and shaped the SEI model in practice today. Conclusions/Recommendations: Arizona's current four-hour model, as implemented in K-12 SEI classrooms, hinders policy intentions: ELLs do not have access to quality instruction, or a curriculum that is comparable in amount, scope, and quality to that of non-ELLs. Furthermore, deficiencies in funding abound, limiting ELLs' opportunities for the compensatory education needed to help them catch up academically. The authors contend that a re-examination of the SEI policy is warranted if the state is to fully realize the intentions of the Flores Consent Order and equal educational opportunity for ELLs.

C2  - Over the past decade, several state and federal policies have directed schools to mainstream English Language Learner (ELL) students into English-only instruction classrooms. While there is mixed evidence on the effects of these immersion policies on the ELL students, research examining potential peer effects on their non-ELL classmates is non-existent. This paper begins to fill in this gap by using a nationally representative longitudinal sample of children in early elementary grades. Results indicate that having an ELL classmate during kindergarten and first grade is associated with lower test score gains in reading but not necessarily in math for non-ELL students whose primary language is English, controlling for unobserved fixed school characteristics as well as individual characteristics. The negative peer effects on reading test score gain are sensitive to the frequency of within classroom ability grouping usage, gender, and household income level of non-ELL children.

AB  - The purpose of the present study is to examine concurrent and predictive evidence used in the validation of ACCUPLACER, a purchased test used to place first-year students into writing courses at an urban, public research university devoted to science and technology education. Concurrent evidence was determined by correlations between ACCUPLACER scores and scores on two other tests designed to measure writing ability: the New Jersey Basic Skills Placement Test and the SAT Writing Section. Predictive evidence was determined by coefficients of determination between ACCUPLACER scores and end-of-semester performance measures. A longitudinal study was also conducted to investigate the grade history of students placed into first-year writing by established and new methods. When analyzed in terms of gender and ethnicity impact, ACCUPLACER failed to achieve statistically significant prediction rates for student performance. The study reveals some limits of placement testing and the problems related to it.

C2  - Prior theory and research suggest that children of immigrants would be at especially high risk for special education placement with learning disabilities. However, their longitudinal special education placement patterns have received scant attention. This study examines temporal patterns of special education placement among children of immigrants, focusing on the timing of special education placement for learning disabilities among first- or second-generation children compared with their third-plus generation peers. Results provide evidence that children of immigrants face comparatively lower odds of receiving early special education intervention services, but demonstrate an increasing risk as the school years progress. This relationship is explained by children of immigrants' frequent participation in English as a second language programs in the early grades.

AB  -  The English Placement Test (EPT) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is designed to provide an accurate placement (or exemption) of international students into the ESL writing and pronunciation classes. Over the last five years, UIUC has experienced an increase in the number of international students taking the EPT. Because of the costs of the EPT, various stakeholders have suggested using TOEFL as a substitute placement tool. The purpose of this research is to find out whether TOEFL iBT can serve as a suitable pre-screening tool for placement of international students into the ESL writing courses at UIUC.  While there is a general statistically significant tendency that students with higher TOEFL iBT scores are placed into higher levels of ESL classes, there is no particular set of either total or section scores which can be used as a reliable criterion for dividing students into ESL classes without significant misplacement. Furthermore, the correlation between TOEFL iBT and the EPT shows a distinct pattern of time dependence: the correlation is stronger when the time gap between these tests is short but it dramatically decreases and even becomes slightly negative around Week 50; however, starting from the 50th week it increases. Some possible interpretations of the findings as well as recommendations for score users are discussed.

	  Educators and researchers have long been interested in determinants of access to honors level and college prep courses in high school. Factors influencing access to upper level mathematics courses are particularly important because of the hierarchical and sequential nature of this subject and because students who finish high school with only lower level courses lack readiness for college and have severely diminished chances for admission to college. Our research analyzes a district-level transcript data set. We examine whether probabilities of enrollment in upper level mathematics courses in high school vary by demographic characteristics, before and after controlling for prior achievement. Before controlling for prior achievement, minority and low-income students have significantly lower odds of placement in upper level mathematics courses; after controlling for prior achievement, the disparities disappear.

C2  - Big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE) research (e.g., Marsh & Parker, 1984) has found that perceptions of academic ability are generally positively related to individual ability and negatively related to classroom and school average ability. However, BFLPE research typically relies on environmental differences as a between-subjects factor. Unlike most previous BFLPE research, the current study used group average ability as a within-subject variable by measuring student self-concept before and after high-ability students left their regular school environment to participate in a supplemental academic summer program. Results revealed that academic self-concept (ASC) and educational aspirations did not undergo significant declines when students were in the relatively higher ability environment. Even with ceiling effects limiting potential increases in ASC, participants were more than 2 times as likely to increase or maintain their ASC as they were to report declines in ASC. Further, several boosts were found in nonacademic self-concepts. Such findings indicate that BFLPEs are not necessarily associated with supplemental educational environments.

AB  -  This study challenges the belief that homogeneous ability grouping benefits high-ability students in cognitive and social-emotional development at the expense of their low-ability peers. From a developmental point of view, the authors hypothesize that homogeneous grouping may improve the learning behaviors and may benefit the literacy learning of kindergartners at all ability levels through adaptive instruction under adequate instructional time. The benefits are expected to be more evident for medium- and low-ability children than for high-ability children. However, when instructional time is limited, low-ability children may suffer from high-intensity grouping, defined as grouping taking up a large proportion of instructional time. The authors also examine whether low-ability kindergartners develop lower self-esteem as a result of homogeneous grouping. Analyzing Early Childhood Longitudinal Study kindergarten cohort data, the authors find no overall advantage of homogeneous grouping for high-ability students. For medium-ability students’ literacy growth, homogeneous grouping appears to be optimal when teachers spend more than 1 hour per day on literacy instruction; high-intensity grouping shows additional advantage for improving these students’ general learning behaviors. For low-ability kindergartners, homogeneous grouping with ample instruction time seems to improve their general learning behaviors, whereas low-intensity grouping with ample instruction time seems to reduce internalizing problem behaviors. Yet for low-ability students’ literacy growth, a detrimental effect of high-intensity grouping is found when instructional time is limited. These findings contradict results from past research and have important implications for educational theories and practice.

C2  - In the education of students who are deaf and hard of hearing (DHH), there is much debate about how placement affects educational outcomes and quality of life. This study examined the relationship between quality of life and educational placement that include and do not include other DHH youth. Participants included 221 DHH youth, ages 11-18 with bilateral hearing loss. Results showed that there were few differences in quality of life related to school placement (with age, gender, depression symptoms, and hearing level as covariates). For both participation and perceived stigma, there was an interaction between school placement and parent hearing status, with no single school placement showing the best results. DHH youth with hearing parents in schools specifically for DHH students scored lower than DHH with deaf parents in some domains (Participation and Perceived Stigma). When the DHH youth were compared with the general population, those in schools that included DHH students scored lower in some aspects of quality of life, particularly Self and Relationships. This study demonstrates that DHH students may not differ much in terms of quality of life across schools placements, but that there may be differences in subsets of DHH youth.

C2  - This study examines the academic experiences of heritage Spanish-speakers who were placed in a traditional Spanish class for non-Spanish speakers at the secondary level. Each of the participants in the study demonstrated advanced-levels of oral proficiency in Spanish yet each was placed in a beginning-level Spanish class. An ethnographic case study method was used to explore the effect of this inappropriate placement on the students' linguistic abilities and academic identities. This study addresses an all-too-common practice that fails to advance heritage language students' knowledge of their native language. The needs of these students differ from those of non-native speakers, and the type of class that they take should reflect this.

Drawing on qualitative data collected throughout the 2008-2009 academic year and a range of quantitative data from New York City’s public high schools, the author shows that while small schools and choice are intended to expand schooling options for all, students with special needs often find that when entering the public high school choice process, their selection set is narrowed. For families of students with special needs, the lack of adequate special needs resources can preclude schools from being considered as viable options. In addition, schools of choice engage in practices to deter higher need students from applying. The combined influences of parent decision and school choice processes result in between-school sorting, with larger institutions receiving the bulk of the higher need population of students, which is reflected in the city’s enrollment data. The findings raise questions about not only the effects of the small school reforms, but also about the role of choice policies in the public educational system.

C2  - Kiara, an African American rising freshman, has aspirations to become a medical doctor. She enrolls at Birch High School because of the reputation of the principal, Mr. Brown, whose vision for academic excellence permeates every corner of the school. Kiara graduates from high school with top honors, but realizes her success may have come at a steep price. By using &quot;snapshots&quot; of five critical aspects of the school culture at Birch, this case study invites readers to consider the ways schools may foster academic success for some students of color, but at what cost?

C2  - We evaluated the effects of one year of schoolwide cluster grouping on the academic achievement growth of gifted and non-identified elementary students using a piecewise multilevel growth model. Scores from 186 non-identified and 68 gifted students' Measures of Academic Progress Reading and Math scores were examined over three school years. In 2008-2009 within-class ability grouping was used. In 2009-2010 schoolwide cluster grouping was implemented. In 2010-2011 students once again were grouped only within classrooms by ability and students identified as gifted were spread across all classrooms at each grade level. Results suggest that schoolwide cluster grouping influenced student performance in the year following its implementation, but only for mathematics and not the area of reading.

C2  - In this paper, I describe the design and evaluation of automated essay scoring (AES) models for an institution's writing placement program. Information was gathered on admitted student writing performance at a science and technology research university in the northeastern United States. Under timed conditions, first-year students (N = 879) were assigned to write essays on two persuasive prompts within the &quot;Criterion&quot;[R] Online Writing Evaluation Service at the beginning of the semester. AES models were built and evaluated for a total of four prompts. AES models meeting recommended performance criteria were then compared to standardized admissions measures and locally developed writing measures. Results suggest that there is evidence to support the use of &quot;Criterion&quot; as part of the placement process at the institution. (Contains 12 tables.)

C2  - Predicting student success has long been a question of interest for postsecondary admission counselors throughout the United States. Past research has examined the validity of several methods designed for predicting undergraduate success. High school record, standardized test scores, extracurricular activities, and combinations of all three have historically been successful predictors. However, in recent years, standardized test scores have become less effective for placing students in lower level mathematics courses; placement exams such as Accuplacer[R] have taken their place, especially in community colleges where no standardized test scores are necessary for admissions. This paper comprises a literature review of past research devoted to predicting community college success. Various state high school graduation requirements were examined as well as the issues surrounding high school mathematics proficiency and its lack of connection to college readiness. Academic aptitude factors--gleaned from high school transcripts analyzed to determine their influence on the need for remedial mathematics as determined by the mathematics portion of the Accuplacer[R] placement exam--were also examined. Significant variables found to influence the probability of remedial mathematics for community college freshmen were overall high school performance determined by the nonweighted high school grade point average (GPA), taking a math class beyond the state-required sequence, and the socioeconomic status of the high school.

AB  - This interpretive study provides a cross-case analysis of the literacy instruction of two first-grade teachers, with a particular focus on their grouping practices. One key finding was the way in which these teachers drew upon a district-advocated approach for instruction—an approach to guided reading articulated by Fountas and Pinnell (1996) in which students are instructed in small groups based on reading level—as a resource for their sense-making. Analysis indicated that the two teachers enacted the practice in distinct ways based on their experiences and personal characteristics. Findings further suggested that, reminiscent of research on ability groups conducted mainly in the 1970s and 1980s, instruction and materials in both classrooms were qualitatively different between lower groups and higher groups. Although we do not implicate the practice of guided reading per se, we call for closer examinations of modern manifestations of ability-grouped practices and explorations of alternatives to such practices.

C2  - The use of tests has been targeted as a critical point in validity, which suggests that contexts for test use warrant closer investigation. This article describes a study of decision making during test use in the context of a university intensive English language program. Over a period of 2 1/2 years, data were collected by audio-recording placement sessions in which the program director and an instructor made decisions based on a three-part placement exam, TOEFL scores, course grades, instructor evaluations, and other information. Analysis of the sessions revealed four major areas impacting test use and the decision-making process: (a) test performance and score factors, (b) student factors, (c) test user factors, and (d) program factors (i.e., number and size of levels, curriculum, textbooks). These four areas represent factors in the placement process that are clearly about tests (test performance and score) and factors that have less relation to tests or scores such as test users and programmatic factors. The test and nontest factors interacted in the placement process to navigate borderlines between levels, confirm placements, and adhere to programmatic constraints.

C2  - The aim of the current study was to evaluate the eleven year longitudinal association between students identified in first grade as having academic and behavior problems and distal outcomes in twelfth grade. The study extends prior research that identified latent classes of academic and behavior problems in a longitudinal community sample of 678 predominately African American first-grade students. The type and number of classes identified in first grade differed by gender, but results indicated that students within the classes of behavior and academic problems had long-term negative outcomes in the twelfth grade. The class with co-occurring academic and behavior problems in first grade had the greatest risk for negative distal outcomes for both boys and girls including higher likelihood of special education placement, mental health service use, poor academic achievement, and school dropout. Implications for prevention, early intervention, and current practices in schools are discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)

C2  - Scores on state standards-based assessments are readily available and may be an appropriate alternative to traditional placement tests for assigning or accepting students into particular courses. Many community colleges do not require test scores for admissions purposes but do require some kind of placement scores for first-year English and math courses. In this study, we examine the efficacy of using the reading and math portions of the Kansas State Assessment (KSA) for predicting the success of high school students taking College Algebra and College English I at a Kansas community college. Results showed that in this sample KSA scores predicted as well or better than more traditional placement tests and with no extra cost to the institution.

C2  - Transfer has become a significant pathway for obtaining a bachelor's degree from four-year institutions. As a result, higher education institutions are faced with an increasing population of transfer students with varied academic backgrounds and readiness levels. Determining the placement of transfer students in the appropriate introductory-level mathematics course presents a distinctive challenge, and has not been the focus of many studies. In response, this article offers an analysis of the difficulties associated with the placement of transfer students and of the variety of practices regarding placement across select institutions. A narrative describing the placement system for transfer students adopted at a public four-year university in Massachusetts, as well as recommendations for other institutions for the implementation of a smooth, efficient and transparent mathematics placement system for transfer students, is provided.

C2  - This study examined relationships among behavior problems, social skills, and educational placement within a sample of children with autism spectrum disorder or ASD in public (mean age 7) and non-public (mean age 8) school settings (n = 56).  Parent and teacher agreement on child characteristics ratings tended to be similar while differences between parent ratings of students in public and non-public school settings found more behavior problems and poorer social skills for students in non-public school placements compared to public school settings. Furthermore, logistic regression analyses indicated that child age, family income, and social skills were predictive of educational placement, with overall prediction success at 87.5%. Current eligibility and diagnosis of ASD, in both clinical and educational settings, is also discussed.

AB  - In an effort to better understand aggregate patterns in the way elementary school students are assigned to classes, we conduct a careful analysis of observed classroom assignment outcomes in the 5th grade in North Carolina elementary schools. First, we model the probability that a pair of students are classmates as a function of the characteristics of that pair of students. This novel methodological technique enables us to directly observe the degree to which actual assignment patterns differ from what might be expected under random assignment for a wide variety of student characteristics. Second, we analyze patterns in classroom assignment and discuss the implications of these patterns. We show that classroom assignments tend to deviate from random assignment in a way that tends to group similar students and that these deviations tend to be greatly magnified in Magnet schools. Importantly, we find evidence that administrators sort students based on attributes not normally observable by researchers. These findings have important implications for researchers using value-added modeling (VAM) techniques. Finally, we find that classroom assignment patterns are generally stable across the racial, income, and geographic characteristics of schools.

C2  - Having garnered national attention, high failure rates in developmental education present a significant barrier to state and national policymakers' goals of increasing the percentage of adults who earn a college credential. However, a majority of the research fails to consider why students place into developmental education. This piece examines a sample of recent high school graduates in Texas who placed into developmental education with the goal of gaining a more nuanced understanding of why these students required remediation. We find that rather than simply blaming the students for their failure to learn basic skills, there are concrete and actionable steps that policymakers and practitioners can take to help students avoid remediation, important actions that would increase students' chances of earning a postsecondary credential.

C2  - This article documents evidence of nonrandom gender sorting across K-12 schools in the United States. The sorting exists among coed schools and at all grade levels, and it is highest in the secondary school grades. We observe some gender sorting across school sectors and types: for instance, males are slightly underrepresented in private schools and charter schools and are substantially overrepresented in irregular public schools, a large share of which educates students with special needs and juvenile justice involvement. Gender sorting within sectors and types is also quite prevalent and appears to be highest within the private schools (where single-sex schools are more common) and irregular public schools. We find that gender sorting is higher in counties that have higher shares of enrollment in private and nonregular public schools. This sorting occurs even though parents have similar stated preferences for school attributes for their sons and daughters. (Contains 5 tables, 1 figure, and 12 notes.)

C2  - The study's main objective was to provide a detailed description of math Assessment and Placement (A&amp;P) policies in the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD). The study was focused on math because a larger proportion of students place into remedial math than remedial reading or English (Bailey, Jeong, &amp; Cho, 2010; Parsad, Lewis, &amp; Greene, 2003). The following questions guided this study: (1) What does an actual set of A&amp;P policies for developmental math look like?; (2) What implications do A&amp;P policies have on student testing, as well as placement and enrollment in and progress though a developmental math sequence?; (3) What strategies and methods do faculty and administrators use to determine A&amp;P policies for developmental math at their colleges?; and (4) What conditions facilitate or constrain colleges from improving A&amp;P policies for developmental math? First, the authors provide a review of the literature on A&amp;P for developmental education, particularly in community colleges. Second, they provide the context of the study by describing the governance structure and state policies that regulate A&amp;P and the LACCD. Third, they outline the study's data and methods. Fourth, they present the study's findings. Finally, conclusions are presented as well as a discussion of the implications recent California legislation has on improving A&amp;P policies.

AB  -  Value-added models (VAMs) are used to measure changes in student achievement on large-scaled standardized test scores from year to year. When aggregated, VAM estimates are used to measure teacher effectiveness and hold teachers accountable for the value they purportedly add to or detract from student learning and achievement. In this study, researchers examined the extent to which purposeful (nonrandom) and random assignment of students into classrooms occurs in Arizona elementary schools (Grades 3–6). Researchers found that overwhelmingly, students are not randomly assigned and administrators, teachers, and parents play a prodigious role in the process. Findings have current implications for value-added analyses and the extent to which nonrandom assignment practices might impact or bias teachers’ value-added scores.

AB  -  A common use of language tests is to support decisions about examinees such as placement into appropriate classes. Research on placement testing has focused on English for Academic Purposes (EAP) in higher education contexts. However, there is little research exploring the use of language tests to place students in English as a Second Language (ESL) support classes in secondary education. The present study examined the relationship between secondary school students’ language test scores from a standardized English-language test and the placement of these students into ESL classes by their language teachers. Ninety-two ESL students in two English-medium schools took TOEFL® Junior™ Standard. For the same students, data collection also included teachers’ judgments regarding the ESL classes the students should attend. Strong correlations between test scores and the teacher-assigned ESL levels were found. Moreover, the results from the logistic regression analysis indicated a great degree of overlap between the teacher-assigned ESL levels and the levels predicted from the TOEFL Junior Standard scores. The findings of this study provide some preliminary evidence to support the use of TOEFL Junior Standard as an initial screening tool for ESL placement. The limitations and implications of these findings for ESL placement decisions in secondary education are also discussed.

C2  - Decreasing the number of students placed in developmental mathematics and addressing barriers that hinder student success in such courses are concerns at both the state and national levels. The present study sought to capture 89 developmental mathematics faculty perceptions of factors that contribute to students' placement and hinder student success in developmental mathematics courses. The results suggest that one of the most common reasons faculty members believe students are placed in developmental mathematics courses, apart from their lack of basic skills, is a time lag between current and previous engagement with mathematics courses. The underlying 17 themes that hinder student success, identified from faculty perspectives, are both personal (e.g., students' individual situations and dispositions) and academic (e.g., their learning behaviors and work habits).

C2  - This research examined the relationship between placement in a learning support college program and subsequent academic outcomes. The sample consisted of 275 entering freshmen students who were enrolled in the Learning Support reading courses in the fall of 2005. Data were collected from the Gordon College Office of Institutional Research. The data showed that of the 275 students who enrolled in a Learning Support reading course in the fall 2005 semester, 189 returned for the spring 2006 semester. Data also showed that 58% of the 275 students enrolled in Learning Support reading during fall 2005 successfully completed a basic reading intensive course upon completion of their remedial reading class. One hundred eighty seven students who had previously completed Learning Support reading enrolled (spring 2006 or later) in Introductory English 101 and 121 passed. Fifty-five students who had completed Learning Support reading enrolled (spring 2006 or later) in History 1121, Western Civilization, and 20 students passed. Six of the 205 students who completed Learning Support reading graduated Gordon College within a three-year period. The results of the present study indicate that the Learning Support Reading Program in place at Gordon College has proven to be a beneficial tool for at-risk college students. It is assumed that programs such as the Learning Support Program described here may help students build a foundation that will aid them throughout their college career.

Results revealed that Black students had reduced odds of being placed in algebra by the time they entered 8th grade even after controlling for performance in mathematics. An important implication of this study is that placement recommendations must be monitored to ensure that high-achieving students are placed appropriately, regardless of racial background.

AB  - The proportion of eighth graders in United States public schools enrolled in algebra or a more advanced mathematics course doubled between 1990 and 2011. This article uses Early Childhood Longitudinal Study's Kindergarten Cohort data to consider the selection process into advanced middle school mathematics courses and estimate the effects of advanced courses on students’ mathematics achievement (n = 6,425; mean age at eighth grade = 13.7). Eighth‐grade algebra and geometry course placements are academically selective, but considerable between‐school variation exists in students’ odds of taking these advanced courses. While analyses indicate that advanced middle school mathematics courses boost student achievement, these effects are most pronounced in content areas closely related to class content and may be contingent on student academic readiness.

AB  -  Remediation is one of the largest single interventions intended to improve outcomes for underprepared college students, yet little is known about the remedial screening process. Using administrative data and a rich predictive model, we find that severe mis-assignments are common using current test-score-cutoff-based policies, with “underplacement” in remediation much more common than “overplacement” college courses. Incorporating high school transcripts into the process could significantly reduce placement errors, but adding test scores to already available high school data often provides little marginal benefit. Moreover, the choice of screening policy has significant implications for the racial and gender composition of college-level courses. Finally, the use of more accurate screening tools would enable institutions to remediate substantially fewer students without compromising college success.

Conducted at an urban community college in the Northeast, data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted over a 3-year period with a cohort of 15 students who were placed into a first-semester LC that linked the lowest level of developmental English with Introduction to Psychology and a student development course. Findings shed light on students’ changing perceptions of their placement in remedial English, their insights into LC participation, and reveal implications for community college research and practice. Developmental students’ experiences, voices, and perspectives are the focus of this study and are analyzed in the context of the highly contentious debate over college remediation.

C2  - This study investigates how teachers interact with immigrant-origin youth in school-based contexts of reception that mediate youth's educational opportunities. One understudied context is sheltered instruction, where English learners (ELs) are placed into separate content-area courses to target their linguistic needs. This qualitative study highlights the unintended consequences of ELs' placements by examining 3 teacher cases in depth. Teachers' accounts reveal that EL content courses designed to increase access were, in fact, stigmatizing spaces where students made social distinctions and engaged in impression management to mitigate perceptions that they lacked intelligence because of their programmatic placements. Teachers also managed stigma in distinct ways, representing different orientations and communication strategies in response to students' experiences of stigma. This investigation raises questions about the tensions embedded in how language status, race, and classification intersect with the very solutions intended to ameliorate inequalities, as well as teachers' roles in the education of immigrant EL-designated youth.

C2  - This paper reports on the cross-disciplinary research that resulted in a decision-support tool, Team Machine (TM), which was designed to create maximally diverse student teams. TM was used at a large United States university between 2004 and 2012, and resulted in significant improvement in the performance of student teams, superior overall balance of the teams as well as overwhelmingly favorable reactions from stakeholders. An empirical study is conducted comparing the performance of teams created by TM compared to teams manually allocated by a subject matter expert. The findings show that optimally balanced teams perform better than those created manually. TM serves as a broad-based example of how to integrate business analytics into interactive search by conflating human judgment with algorithmic efficiency in the context of team formation. The contribution of this research to the academic community is a model and solution method which can be easily implemented to solve a very important and recurring issue faced by many MBA programs and empirical evidence of its value. The outcomes of this study include empirical evidence of increased team performance, significant administrative time savings, improvement to team diversity, and increased satisfaction from students and administrators with the team formation process.

Drawing on a regression discontinuity design, we used data from 3,429 community college students, nested within 223 classrooms, to explore the extent to which classroom and instructor characteristics moderated the effect of developmental English students’ performance in a successive, college-level English course. Our results suggest developmental English students’ college-level course performance benefited from developmental education but was modified by classroom and instructor characteristics. On average, the impact of participating in the developmental English program was greater when developmental students were enrolled in classrooms that contained a higher proportion of developmental students. Achievement for developmental students was also enhanced when developmental students enrolled in classrooms taught by full-time instructors. Findings suggest that after underprepared students completed developmental English, classroom composition in the first, college-level English course had significant influence on developmental students’ performance.

AB  -  Long-term, adolescent English language learners (ELLs) experience persistent academic underachievement in spite of several years of schooling; yet, the research on this topic is scant. To increase our understanding of these students’ educational experiences, we explored perceptions of 13 long-term ELLs about their schooling in the context of their school history, including program placements, special education referral, and academic outcomes. Data from semistructured interviews and documents were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Participants viewed themselves as English-proficient, motivated learners, and described their school experience as positive but challenging. The findings revealed a gap between their postsecondary aspirations and the reality of their academic performance, which raises questions about the adequacy of educational programs and identification of ELLs with disabilities.

C2  - Community college students are often placed in developmental math courses based on the results of a single placement test. However, concerns about accurate placement have recently led states and colleges across the country to consider using other measures to inform placement decisions. While the relationships between college outcomes and such measures as high school GPA, prior math achievement, and noncognitive measures are well-known, there is little research that examines whether using these measures for course placement improves placement decisions. We provide evidence from California, where community colleges are required to use multiple measures, and examine whether this practice increases access and success in college-level courses. Using data from the Los Angeles Community College District, we find that students who were placed into higher-level math due to multiple measures (e.g., GPA and prior math background) performed no differently from their higher scoring peers in terms of passing rates and long-term credit completion. The findings suggest that community colleges can improve placement accuracy in developmental math and increase access to higher-level courses by considering multiple measures of student preparedness in their placement rules.

C2  - Politics of education researchers have long recognized the role of micropolitics in school decision-making processes. We argue that investigating micropolitical dynamics is key to an important set of school decisions that are fundamental to inequities in access to high-quality teachers: assignments of teachers and students to classrooms. Focusing on the intraorganizational political power of experienced teachers, our analysis of survey and administrative data from a large urban district suggests that more experienced teachers have more influence over which students are assigned to their classrooms. By a variety of measures, we also find that more experienced teachers are assigned fewer disadvantaged students, on average, a pattern inconsistent with goals of ameliorating educational inequality by matching more qualified teachers with the students who need them most.

AB  -  Typically, child characteristics such as IQ and severity of autism symptoms are thought to determine educational placement. The present study examines external factors, including state of residence and state funding formulas, to determine their potential influence on placement outcomes. Findings reveal that considerable variations exist among states in placing students with autism spectrum disorders in inclusive, mainstreaming, self-contained, and separate schools. This variation suggests that factors beyond child characteristics, such as IQ, play a major role in educational placement decisions. Furthermore, states in the Eastern United States tend to have more restrictive placement rates than states in the Western United States. State special education funding was found to have a minimal impact on placement outcomes. As a whole, it is unlikely that child characteristics alone determine placement outcomes.

C2  - This study examined the influence of academic teaming (i.e., sharing academic classes with the same classmates) on the relationship between social preference and peer victimization among 6th-grade students in middle school. Approximately 1,000 participants were drawn from 5 middle schools that varied in their practice of academic teaming. A novel methodology for measuring academic teaming at the individual level was employed, in which students received their own teaming score based on the unique set of classmates with whom they shared academic courses in their class schedule. On the basis of both peer-and self-reports of victimization, the results of 2 path models indicated that students with low social preference in highly teamed classroom environments were more victimized than low-preference students who experienced less teaming throughout the school day. This effect was exaggerated in higher performing classrooms. Implications for the practice of academic teaming were discussed.

C2  - This multiple case study described the experiences of case managers making mathematics placement decisions for high school students with high incidence disabilities. Participants included three parents, three students, three case managers, three mathematics teachers, and three administrators from different high schools across rural, suburban and urban settings. Findings from the case studies indicated that the placement process was a team decision, but a lack of meaningful parent participation among parents was perceived at all sites. Additionally, although a range of special education services was available, not all student needs were being met across the sites.

The vast majority (93%) of students were served in self-contained classrooms, separate schools, or home settings, whereas only 7% were served in regular education or resource room placements. There was a significant, positive correlation between expressive communication and reading and math skill levels with increasingly inclusive classroom settings and a significant, negative correlation between use of AAC and more inclusive settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.

C2  - This study examined the educational environment placement and educational outcomes of students identified as having an emotional disturbance (ED). The sample was drawn from special education enrollment data for students aged 6-21 years in the 50 states and Washington, DC in 2010. Additional economic and demographic state-level variables were examined to determine associations with the previously noted variables. The results of this study show substantial state-level variability in the educational outcomes of students with ED, with the rate of students with ED graduating with a regular diploma four times as high in some states as it is in others. Additionally, regression analysis indicated that state-level ED identification rates were significantly predictive of students with ED graduating with a regular diploma. Implications of the substantial variability and of further research are discussed.

AB  -  Many school districts have recently revised, or tried to revise, their policies for assigning students to schools, because the legal and political status of racial and other kinds of diversity is uncertain, and the districts are facing fiscal austerity. This article presents case studies of politics and student assignment policy in three large school districts: Boston, Massachusetts; Wake County (Raleigh), North Carolina; and Jefferson County (Louisville), Kentucky. In all three districts, there has been pressure to change student-assignment policies in ways that respond to the priorities of White and middle-class populations, with the potential to worsen the options available to students of color. Our case studies reinforce the criticisms of race-neutral politics and policy that have been made by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and others. Race-neutral politics during fiscal retrenchment tends to reframe privilege as common sense and to obscure some students’ structural disadvantages.

AB  -  Research suggests that the academic achievement of deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students is the result of a complex interplay of many factors. These factors include characteristics of the students (e.g., hearing thresholds, language fluencies, mode of communication, and communication functioning), characteristics of their family environments (e.g., parent education level, socioeconomic status), and experiences inside and outside school (e.g., school placement, having been retained at grade level). This paper examines the relative importance of such characteristics to U.S. DHH secondary students’ academic achievement as indicated by the Woodcock-Johnson III subtests in passage comprehension, mathematics calculation, science, and social studies. Data were obtained for approximately 500 DHH secondary students who had attended regular secondary schools or state-sponsored special schools designed for DHH students. Across all subject areas, having attended regular secondary schools and having better spoken language were associated with higher test scores. Significant negative predictors of achievement varied by type of subtest but included having an additional diagnosis of a learning disability, having a mild hearing loss, and being African American or Hispanic. The findings have important implications for policy and practice in educating DHH students as well for interpreting previous research.

AB  -  Despite decades of advocacy, most students with developmental disabilities continue to spend the majority of the school day in self-contained special education classrooms. However, there is tremendous variability of educational placement across the United States. Identification of geographic trends that explain this variability could provide opportunities for targeted advocacy. Using state-level data in Ohio, we tested the hypothesis that urbanicity predicts educational placement. Through mapping and multivariate analysis of variance, we found that students in urban districts tended to spend less time in general education classrooms, and students in rural districts tended to spend more time in general education classrooms. Furthermore, the urban districts with the largest enrollments tended to place an even lower proportion of students in general education classrooms. Given their disproportionate influence on state trends and propensity toward more self-contained and segregated placements, large urban districts offer a unique opportunity for targeted advocacy and change.

Outcomes of 13 ability grouping meta-analyses showed that students benefited from within-class grouping (0.19 ≤ g ≤ 0.30), cross-grade subject grouping (g = 0.26), and special grouping for the gifted (g = 0.37), but did not benefit from between-class grouping (0.04 ≤ g ≤0.06); the effects did not vary for high-, medium-, and low-ability students. Three acceleration meta-analyses showed that accelerated students significantly outperformed their nonaccelerated same-age peers (g = 0.70) but did not differ significantly from nonaccelerated older peers (g = 0.09).

C2  - This qualitative case-study explores questions about the stratifying role of public alternative schools created for &quot;at-risk&quot; youth by analyzing the school experience of students who attend a single continuation high school and the process of student enrollment and referral to that school. Drawing on the concept of whiteness as property, this article demonstrates how the continuation high school maintained and protected the property functions of whiteness through acts of symbolic violence and the systematic removal of non-white students from the school district's mainstream high school. Instead, students were placed in a substandard alternative school lacking in material and intellectual resources. Furthermore, teachers, counselors, and administrative staff at the mainstream and continuation high schools alike drew upon the racial ideology of merit to rationalize the overrepresentation of non-white youths at the study school and to &quot;deracialize&quot; the student referral process.

AB  -  The article presents a longitudinal study of an urban charter middle school to examine the impact testing pressures can have on the education of students with disabilities and English language learners, and how this may lead to a narrowing of the content they are taught. The study examines various sources of data, including the school's evolving language, literacy, and math programs, high-stakes test results, school improvement plans, and written IEP goals. Over several years, as low test scores and failure to make AYP had an increasing impact on school life, skills specifically targeted on annual state tests became the guide for how math and literacy and language development were addressed. In effect, instruction in these areas became equated with test preparation. As ranges in proficiency led to ability grouping in pertinent courses, there was a narrowing of skills addressed in the lower-level classes that were entirely populated by students categorized as limited-English proficient and/or having a disability. In effect, this turned test preparation into the math and literacy curricula for these students, which in turn affected decisions regarding which skills would be addressed in students’ IEPs. Implications for schools, policy, and further research are suggested.

Utilizing statewide data on students with disabilities from Massachusetts from 2005 through 2012, the author conducted discrete-time survival analysis to estimate the conditional probability of high school graduation in a given year after high school entry by disability category and placement in the general education setting. Results suggest that, across all disability categories, the peak conditional probability for graduation occurs 4 years after high school entry. In addition, students with disabilities who are fully included have higher graduation probability profiles than students with disabilities who are educated in substantially-separate settings.

AB  -  In 2003, Chicago launched “Double-Dose Algebra,” requiring students with pretest scores below the national median to take two periods of math–algebra and supplemental coursework. In many schools, assignment to Double Dose changed the peer composition of the algebra classroom. Using school-specific instrumental variables within a regression-discontinuity design (RDD), we find that attending a lower skill classroom reduced math achievement for median-skill students. As a result, the Double-Dose policy had little or no effect for median-skill students in schools that exposed them to low-skill classrooms. However, the effects of Double Dose were substantially positive in schools that did not do so. We consider policy implications and interpretations of the results from RDDs.

AB  -  Previous research has indicated benefits and potential pitfalls of within-class homogeneous and heterogeneous ability grouping for elementary math learning. However, there has been scant evidence with regard to the impacts of grouping for language minority kindergartners who may experience the small group setting differentially due to their particular needs for math and English language skill development. Analyzing the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten cohort data, we find that heterogeneous grouping or a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous grouping under relatively adequate time allocation is optimal for enhancing teacher ratings of language minority kindergartners’ math performance, while using homogeneous grouping only is detrimental. As hypothesized, suboptimal instructional organization seems to place language minority kindergartners in a vulnerable situation.

AB  -  This study uses student panel data to examine the association between algebra placement and student motivation for mathematics. Changes in achievement goals, expectancy, and task value for students in eighth-grade algebra are compared with those of peers placed in lower-level mathematics courses (N = 3,306). In our sample, students placed in algebra reported an increase in performance-avoidance goals as well as decreases in academic self-efficacy and task value. These relations were attenuated for students who had high mathematics achievement prior to algebra placement. Whereas all students reported an overall decline in performance-approach goals over the course of eighth grade, previously high-achieving students reported an increase in these goals. Lastly, previously high-achieving students reported an increase in mastery goals. These findings suggest that while previously high-achieving students may benefit motivationally from eighth-grade algebra placement, placing previously average- and low-performing students in algebra can potentially undermine their motivation for mathematics.

C2  - Educational placement of students with autism is often associated with child factors, such as IQ and communication skills. However, variability in placement patterns across states suggests that other factors are at play. This study used hierarchical cluster analysis techniques to identify demographic, economic, and educational covariates associated with placement patterns across states in highly inclusive, moderately inclusive, moderately restrictive, and highly restrictive clusters. Findings indicate that highly inclusive states are more rural, have more adults with high school diplomas and more White citizens compared to other clusters. States that are highly restrictive were largely less economically and racially privileged. These findings suggest an inequitable access to the least restrictive environment for students with autism. Implications of these findings are included.

AB  - Inequalities in educational opportunity are well documented. Regardless of the nature of the disadvantage—low income, underrepresented minority status, or prior achievement—students from backgrounds associated with a given disadvantage have less access to educational opportunities. In this article, we use data from the 2012 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education to explore how resources are allocated for science instruction specifically. We focus on how three kinds of resources—well-prepared teachers, material resources, and instruction itself—are allocated to classes that are homogeneously grouped by prior achievement level. Regardless of the resource, we find that classes of students with low prior achievement (as perceived by their teachers) have less access. Some of the differences are striking, particularly regarding access to material resources, while others are more subtle. There is also evidence that some policies do not impact teachers equally. For example, time allowed for teacher professional development is perceived differently by teachers in terms of its impact depending on the achievement level of students in the class. The study supports the assertion that what is known about ability grouping in general applies in science instruction specifically. When students with low prior achievement are grouped together, their classes have less access to critical resources for science learning opportunities, potentially widening the gap between them and their higher-achieving peers.

AB  - Background Although we have learned a good deal from lottery-based and quasi-experimental studies of charter schools, much of what goes on inside of charter schools remains a “black box” to be unpacked. Grounding our work in neoclassical market theory and institutional theory, we examine differences in the social organization of schools and classrooms to enrich our understanding of school choice, school organizational and instructional conditions, and student learning. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study Our study examines differences in students’ mathematics achievement gains between charter and traditional public schools, focusing on the distribution and organization of students into ability groups. In short, we ask: (1) How does the distribution of ability grouping differ between charter and traditional public schools? And (2) What are the relationships between ability group placement and students’ mathematics achievement gains in charter and traditional public schools? Research Design With a matched sample of charter and traditional public schools in six states (Colorado, Delaware, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio), we use regression analyses to estimate the relationship between student achievement gains and school sector. We analyze how ability grouping mediates this main effect, controlling for various student, classroom, and school characteristics. Findings We find significant differences in the distribution of students across ability groups, with a more even distribution in charter compared to traditional public schools, which appear to have more selective placements for high groups. Consistent with prior research on tracking, we also find low-grouped students to be at a significant disadvantage when compared with high- and mixed-group peers in both sectors. Conclusions Although we find some significant differences between ability group placement and student achievement gains in mathematics, these relationships do not differ as much by sector as market theory (with its emphasis on innovation and autonomy) would predict. Consistent with institutional theory, both sectors still group students by ability and have similar relationships between gains and grouping.

AB  -  Changing placement policy may help to improve developmental education student outcomes in community colleges, but there is little understanding of the impacts of these reforms. We take advantage of heterogeneous placement policy in a large urban community college district in California to compare the effects of math remediation under different policy contexts. District colleges either switched from using math diagnostics to using computer-adaptive tests, or raised placement cutoffs. We use quasi-experimental methods to identify the impact of remediation under each policy and the change in impact following placement policy experimentation. We find that switching to a computer-adaptive test exacerbated the penalty of remediation for marginal students and resulted in more placement errors. Modestly raising placement cutoffs had no significant effects.

C2  - As writing has assumed increasing importance in discussions of pedagogy for diverse classrooms, attention to the contexts in which secondary teachers develop and implement writing instruction for adolescent English language learners (ELLs) is of great importance. Drawing on ecological language learning theories and situated teacher learning theory (van Lier, 2003; Borko, 2004), the authors present findings from participants in a focus group (N = 10) and follow-up interviews (N = 6) conducted with a set of secondary English language arts and English as a second language (ESL) teachers. Within overlapping institutional/professional and pedagogical contexts, teachers identified teacher expertise, high-stakes testing, classroom assessment and grading, placement and tracking, and disciplinary disconnects as the ecological factors most influential in their instructional choices related to ELL writers. Implications of these findings for research and teacher education are discussed.

C2  - Many students with emotional and behavioral disorders placed in alternative education settings lack resilience and are likely to experience failure in school and beyond without carefully designed intervention programs. Although researchers have examined both resilience in children and youth and their placement in alternative education settings, there is little research regarding resilience among students who have graduated from alternative education settings. Using semistructured interviews in the present interpretive and descriptive qualitative study, we sought to explore factors of resilience in individuals who graduated from alternative education settings. Further, we wanted to identify elements specific to alternative education settings that may contribute to resilience in young adulthood and to further our understanding of how alternative education placements have contributed to the participants' current life status. Finally, we discuss the participants' perspectives of their school experiences and the major themes that emerged.

C2  - Although much of the current educational research literature on achievement gaps has focused on core curricular areas in public schools, few have focused on racially identifiable gaps in non-core areas such as high school foreign languages. These achievement, and thus advancement, gaps often result in the under-representation of students of color in higher level foreign language classes. This can have long-range negative consequences for students, such as lacking the foreign language credits needed for admission into major universities. Thus, in this qualitative study, we researched the perceptions of teachers, counselors, and school leaders at a racially diverse urban high school in central Texas concerning the enrollment, achievement, and advancement of African American students in high school foreign language courses. The results indicate that equity traps--deficit views, racial erasure, and paralogical beliefs and behaviors--advanced over a decade ago (McKenzie &amp; Scheurich, 2004) are continuing and even thriving among teachers, counselors, and school leaders in public schools. These equity traps contribute to the foreign language achievement gap, resulting in diminished educational opportunities for African American students. Moreover, we propose that an additional equity trap is at play--organizational constraints--which are the structural obstacles that serve to abet and perpetuate the negative beliefs, behaviors, attitudes, and assumptions exposed in the original equity traps. We conclude this article with recommendations for policy makers and practitioners and offer direction for future research.

AB  -  The present study investigates the relationship between childhood placement in special education and adult well-being among 1,377 low-income, minority children participating in the Chicago Longitudinal Study. Roughly 16% of the sample received special education services in Grades 1 to 8. After accounting for sociodemographic factors and early academic achievement, children receiving special education services tended to have lower rates of high school completion and fewer years of education, as well as greater rates of incarceration, substance misuse, and depression. Eighth-grade academic achievement significantly mediated the association between childhood placement in special education and adult well-being outcomes. The study contributes to the literature by providing support for a pathway from childhood special education placement to adult outcomes among an inner-city minority cohort.

AB  -  Using an integrated administrative data set, out-of-home residential placements (i.e., child welfare, juvenile justice, mental health) were examined in a sample of early adolescents in a large urban school district. Out-of-home placements were tracked across Grades 7 to 9 in a population of 58,000 youth. This included 10,911 students identified for special education (7,028 with learning disabilities, 1,247 with serious emotional disturbance, 1,245 with intellectual disabilities, 804 with speech and language impairments, and 587 with other disabilities). Students who received special education were twice as likely to experience out-of-home placements. The rates and types of out-of-home placements were differentially related to specific special education classifications. In particular, youth with serious emotional disturbance were more likely to experience out-of-home placements and to be involved in multiple sectors. Findings are discussed in relation to the development of intensive emotional and behavioral interventions for early adolescents who receive special education services.

AB  - Academic tracking, placing students in different classes based on past performance, is a common feature of the American secondary school system. A longitudinal study of secondary students' chemistry self-concept scores was conducted, and one feature of the study was the presence of academic tracking. Though academic tracking is one way to group data for analysis, since students are naturally grouped in their classes, we aimed to uncover other groupings characterized by their self-concept scores. A cluster analysis was performed using scores from the chemistry and mathematics subscales of the chemistry self-concept inventory. The analysis yielded five clusters, four of which demonstrate a positive relationship between chemistry and mathematics self-concept scores. One cluster, however, was composed of students with low chemistry self-concept scores and high mathematics self-concept scores. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), new to chemistry education research (CER), were used to identify smaller groupings of students within the clusters to better understand students' self-concept. This technique was also used to explore longitudinal trends in students' chemistry self-concept data. This work has important implications for tracking in chemistry, the value of considering the affective characteristics of chemistry students, and the prospect of SOMs as a new CER tool.

AB  -  Students of color are underrepresented in gifted programs relative to White students, but the reasons for this underrepresentation are poorly understood. We investigate the predictors of gifted assignment using nationally representative, longitudinal data on elementary students. We document that even among students with high standardized test scores, Black students are less likely to be assigned to gifted services in both math and reading, a pattern that persists when controlling for other background factors, such as health and socioeconomic status, and characteristics of classrooms and schools. We then investigate the role of teacher discretion, leveraging research from political science suggesting that clients of government services from traditionally underrepresented groups benefit from diversity in the providers of those services, including teachers. Even after conditioning on test scores and other factors, Black students indeed are referred to gifted programs, particularly in reading, at significantly lower rates when taught by non-Black teachers, a concerning result given the relatively low incidence of assignment to own-race teachers among Black students.

AB  - Background Virtually all high schools offer a range of courses to allow students to enroll in four years of high school mathematics. However, only two thirds of U.S. high school graduates took mathematics courses each school year. Purpose/Research Question This study addresses three research questions: First, how do students’ math course enrollment and motivational beliefs (i.e., self-efficacy in math, math utility, interest in math, and college expectations) differ by math track? Second, what is the relationship between students’ motivational beliefs and their decision to take four years of math? Third, to what extent does this relationship vary by math track and whether a student passes or fails a math course? Much of the relevant prior literature approaches these relations primarily from an individualistic psychological perspective, viewing motivation as a student-level attribute that similarly effects students’ decision-making process. By contrast, our analyses take a more contextual approach, focusing particular attention on the ways in which students’ math track placements shape their academic approaches and moderate the link between motivation and course-taking. Research Design This study uses secondary restricted-access data from the nationally representative Education Longitudinal Study (ELS: 2002). Students were surveyed and tested in mathematics during the base year (2002). In the follow-up (2004) year, data collectors requested academic transcripts for all participants along with follow-up student surveys and an additional math exam. Findings Our results coincide with previous motivation research that shows that students opt to take additional math courses when they are interested in math, consider themselves skillful in math, and have high college expectations. But the motivational predictors of math course enrollment vary with students’ initial math placement. For above-track students, interest in math is the strongest indicator that they will take four years of math, followed by self-efficacy in mathematics and college expectations, respectively. In contrast, for both low-track and on-track students, the strongest indicator of taking four years of math is college expectations. Conclusions Our study focused on students’ motivation and course enrollment, but this does not diminish the importance of tracking, curricular rigor, and teacher pedagogy. This study provides an additional way to improve inequities in math course enrollment, which is by making explicit recommendations for enhancing students’ motivation. Understanding which particular beliefs have the greatest influence on specific student groups allows educators to appropriately allocate limited resources and increase math course enrollment. This would likely be more effective than a one-size-fits-all approach.

C2  - This study describes student behavior through the actual assessment and placement (A&amp;P) process. It then uses an alternative A&amp;P policy that utilizes an additional measure that assesses prior math preparedness alongside subtest choice. Utilizing data from a community college that allows its' students to choose the assessment subtest used to place them, we find a misalignment between students' subtest choice and the highest math course they passed. After correcting for this misalignment through our alternative A&amp;P criteria, we found that students experience increased access to higher levels of math while exhibiting similar success rates in their placed courses.

C2  - In California adult schools, standardized language assessments are typically administered to adult English as a second language (ESL) students upon enrollment; students then take these same state-approved tests throughout the academic year to demonstrate progress. As these tests assess only listening and reading skills, schools may use their own internally developed assessments to more accurately place students and subsequently to determine level promotion. Engaged in participatory action research, the researcher interviewed adult school staff to document their varying assessment policies and procedures of adult ESL learners, highlighting the agency-created assessments that provide critical information of students' language proficiencies and achievements. This study underscores the discrepancies between the state's policies and actual pedagogical needs, and it proposes ways to reconstruct how ESL assessment is conducted, such as making available a wider, more comprehensive base of assessments for schools to use, and proposing an updated, common set of standards for use statewide.

AB  - This study investigated how student and school-level socioeconomic status (SES) measures predict students’ odds of being identified for special education, particularly high-incidence disabilities. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten cohort, hierarchical models were used to determine the relations of student and school SES to special education identification. Results indicated neither student-level SES variables for parent education, prestige, and income, nor school-level aggregates of SES measures, predicted overall special education placement, but higher parent education attainment was negatively related to high-incidence disability identification (adjusted odds ratio = 0.73). These findings suggest that racial disproportionality is not attributable to racial differences in income and indicate a need for further investigation of the mechanisms by which the longstanding racial disparities in special education emerge and are maintained. In particular, we discuss the implications of this study for further research into the relations of indicators of parent’s status on educational decisions within special education.

C2  - Despite data-driven decision making being a ubiquitous part of policy and school reform efforts, little is known about how teachers use data for instructional decision making. Drawing on data from a qualitative case study of four elementary schools, we examine the logic and patterns of teacher decision making about differentiation and ability grouping. We find that district and school policies conditioned teachers' decision making through mandated time for instructional differentiation, curricular tools, and online program adoption. Educators used various strategies reflecting different logics, types of data used, and sources of decision making. Implications for theory and research are discussed.

C2  - The article describes how a group of student teachers understood and enacted inclusion in noninclusive school placements during a year-long teaching residency. It examines, within de Certeau's framework of tactics and strategies, how students made meaning of their placements, their understanding of university practice in relation to inclusion, and their developing teaching identities as inclusive educators. The fissure between university and school praxis, and the student's relationship to that disconnect, is at the heart of this research. Moreover, the tension between the participants' pedagogical underpinnings of what constitutes effective teaching practice' and the ways they experienced their school sites through the adoption of an inclusive ideological framework, informed how participants resisted and negotiated daily interactions within established systems and structures.

C2  - Many assume that moving honors students into separate sections adversely affects the academic performance of non-honors students, an assumption the authors faced at their institution. In the context of a study done in a college of engineering, that perception is even stronger because peer-to-peer and group projects are such important pedagogical elements of the engineering undergraduate curriculum. Their study indicates that the implementation of honors sections for selected core courses in the University of Iowa (UI) College of Engineering did not adversely affect non-honors engineering students taking those same core courses.

C2  - The researchers examined how speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in a small northern California school district assessed Spanish speaking English learning (EL) Latino children suspected of language impairments. Specifically we sought to (1) determine whether SLPs adhered to federal, state, and professional guidelines during initial assessments and (2) identify tests and measures used by SLPs during language assessments. The researchers conducted a records abstraction review of 88 speech-language assessment reports of Spanish speaking EL Latino children. The reports were examined for parameters of best practice as outlined in recent studies. Results indicated that for each report the SLP responsible for assessing the child failed to consider at least one best practice parameter. Although impossible to determine at this stage, it is likely that many of these children were erroneously assessed and subsequently placed in speech-language programs. Findings support the notion that many EL Latino children continue to be inappropriately assessed for language impairments.

C2  - This investigation employs Disability Critical Race Studies as a theoretical framework to determine the interdependence of racism and ableism in school settings. African American male students with learning disabilities are queried about their interpretations of special education placement and labeling while attempting to secure educational opportunities during high school. Their responses were used to determine the consequences of labeling as they intersect with factors such as race, gender and, to a lesser extent, social economic status. Subsequently, as a result of this investigation, implications for empowering students through self-advocacy and enhancing teachers' knowledge of diverse learning styles are discussed.

The sample consisted of 415 students. Specifically, the study investigated whether factors including students’ prior special education experiences, parental involvement, parental expectations and educational risk factors explain the placement of students in classrooms. Results indicate significant relations between the explanatory variables and the hours spent daily in general education classrooms. However, only two variables, parents’ education and receipt of early childhood special education services, were significantly associated with the dichotomised outcome of whether or not a child received any academic instruction in a general education classroom. Research limitations and implications for future research, policy and practice in the international context are discussed.

AB  -  In language programs, it is crucial to place incoming students into appropriate levels to ensure that course curriculum and materials are well targeted to their learning needs. Deciding how and where to set cutscores on placement tests is thus of central importance to programs, but previous studies in educational measurement disagree as to which standard-setting method (or methods) should be employed in different contexts. Furthermore, the results of different standard-setting methods rarely converge on a single set of cutscores, and standard-setting procedures within language program placement testing contexts specifically have been relatively understudied. This study aims to compare and evaluate three different standard-setting procedures – the Bookmark method (a test-centered approach), the Borderline group method (an examinee-centered approach), and cluster analysis (a statistical approach) – and to discuss the ways in which they do and do not provide valid and reliable information regarding placement cut-offs for an intensive English program at a large Midwestern university in the USA. As predicted, the cutscores derived from the different methods did not converge on a single solution, necessitating a means of judging between divergent results. We discuss methods of evaluating cutscores, explicate the advantages and limitations associated with each standard-setting method, recommend against using statistical approaches for most English for academic purposes (EAP) placement contexts, and demonstrate how specific psychometric qualities of the exam can affect the results obtained using those methods. Recommendations for standard setting, exam development, and cutscore use are discussed.

C2  - Low success rates in developmental mathematics courses have caused a growing concern for many institutions including four-year universities. As a result, institutions have adopted various course redesign models intended to improve developmental mathematics course completion rates. The co-requisite model of instruction is one alternative pathway for students with developmental needs. This model allows students to enroll in the required general education gateway mathematics course concurrent with a developmental mathematics lab, offering student-centered instruction and just-in-time support for student learning. This study contributes to the current body of knowledge by investigating relationships between possible placement variables and student performance in the co-requisite model.

AB  - Prior research and anecdotal evidence from educators suggest that classroom peers play a meaningful role in how students learn. However, the literature has failed to consider the dynamic and context-dependent nature of classroom peer influence. Developmental psychology theories suggest that peer influence will increase and family influence will decrease as children enter adolescence. This study uses rich administrative data from North Carolina in 2006 to 2012, matching students to all peers in each of their courses in third through eighth grades. The analysis identifies trends in the magnitude of classroom peer effects across grade levels, with special attention to controlling for confounding factors such as simultaneous influence, student–classroom sorting, nonlinearity, and school-type effects. Consistent with psychological theories about adolescence, our findings indicate that the effect of average peer quality multiplies by a factor of nearly 3 for reading and 5 for math between fourth grade and seventh grade; contemporaneously, family socioeconomic status effects on academic performance nearly vanish by the end of middle school. We uncover additional evidence that ability grouping, while often harmful in an elementary school setting, becomes increasingly beneficial in later grades—particularly for math subjects.

C2  - This article reports on a study designed to estimate the effect of high school coursetaking in the algebra-calculus pipeline on the likelihood of placing out of postsecondary remedial mathematics. A nonparametric variant of propensity score analysis was used on a nationally representative data set to remove selection bias and test for an effect among all comparable students and among students least likely to enroll in precalculus, trigonometry, or calculus. The effect failed to reach practical significance among all comparable students and was particularly weak among students least likely to take precalculus, trigonometry, or calculus. These findings suggest that the regression-based results that factor strongly into discussions on high school graduation requirements for mathematics coursetaking contain substantial selection bias.

Highlighting one urban school district—Chicago Public Schools—we examined differences in racial composition at their elite, “selective enrollment” high schools before and after voluntary race-based policies became unconstitutional. Using repeated measures ANOVA, we found the transition from racial to socioeconomic criteria have resegregated these schools— significantly reducing African- and Asian-American enrollment. We argue the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down voluntary race-based student assignment policies has contributed to local policy changes for urban districts like Chicago, reducing minority access and opportunity.

C2  - In this paper, we present findings from a preliminary analysis of transcript data in the High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS:09), a large-scale longitudinal investigation of academic achievement among U.S. high school students. Using proportional flow diagrams of course-taking patterns, we illustrate differences in calculus completion associated with non-malleable student characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES), as well as malleable student characteristics, such as knowledge of mathematics in ninth grade, the level of mathematics course they take in ninth grade, and self-efficacy. Confirming and extending findings from prior literature, we conclude that &quot;tracks&quot; through high school mathematics curriculum, together with students' ethnicity, SES, and self-efficacy, converge as important factors associated with which of the approximately 19% of high school students complete calculus in high school.

AB  - Desegregated schools are linked to educational and social advantages whereas myriad harms are connected to segregated schools, yet the emphasis on school desegregation has recently receded in two North Carolina city-suburban school districts historically touted for their far-reaching efforts: Charlotte and Raleigh. In this article, we use cross-case analysis to explore segregation outcomes associated with policy changes by analyzing enrollment and segregation trends from 1989 to 2010 in metro Charlotte and metro Raleigh. Both Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Wake County school systems are experiencing a growing share of intensely segregated schools, decreasing exposure of Black and Latino students to White students, disproportionately large exposure of Black and Latino students to poor students, and an increase in segregated charters. Segregation in the districts surrounding Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Wake County is less extreme. An understanding of how policies have contributed to segregation patterns in both metros informs future education reform efforts.

AB  -  This study uses a North Carolina administrative data set to analyze racial segregation and student achievement in Wake County during race-based and income-based school assignment plans. We find a modest increase in the level of racial segregation in Wake schools during the income-based plan, but compared with other large districts in the state, Wake County remained relatively desegregated. We also find a small increase in reading and math test scores and a narrowing of the Black-White test score gap. Our analysis indicates that the improvement in math scores may be partially due to school composition changes attributable to the income-based assignment plan.

AB  - Background/Context Most community colleges across the country use a placement test to determine students’ readiness for college-level coursework, yet these tests are admittedly imperfect instruments. Researchers have documented significant problems stemming from overreliance on placement testing, including placement error and misdiagnosis of remediation needs. They have also described significant consequences of misplacement, which can hinder the educational progression and attainment of community college students. Purpose/Objective/Research Question We explore possibilities for placing community college students in mathematics courses using a holistic approach that considers measures beyond placement test scores. This includes academic background measures, such as high school GPA and math courses taken, and indicators of noncognitive constructs, such as motivation, time use, and social support. Setting The study draws upon administrative data from a large urban community college district in California that serves over 100,000 students each semester. The data enable us to link students’ placement testing results, survey data, background information, and transcript records. Research Design We first use the supplemental survey data gathered during routine placement testing to conduct predictive exercises that identify severe placement errors under existing placement practices. We then move beyond prediction and evaluate student outcomes in two colleges where noncognitive indicators were directly factored into placement algorithms. Findings/Results Using high school background information and noncognitive indicators to predict success reveals as many as one quarter of students may be misassigned to their math courses by status quo practices. In our subsequent analysis we find that students placed under a holistic approach that considered noncognitive indicators in addition to placement test scores performed no differently from higher scoring peers in the same course. Conclusions/Recommendations The findings suggest a holistic approach to mathematics course placement may improve placement accuracy and provide access to higher level mathematics courses for community college students without compromising their likelihood of success.

AB  - Background/Context While some commentators view education as a social mobility mechanism, many scholars argue that schools reproduce rather than challenge social inequality. A vast literature on the role of family background and educational stratification identifies various factors that help account for how schools contribute to reproducing social inequality. Over the past quarter century local, state, and federal policymakers, motivated at least partially by widening race- and class-based achievement gaps, have used standards and high stakes accountability to hold schools accountable for student performance. But the available evidence on the efficacy of these policy instruments in reducing the role of schools in social stratification is mixed. Purpose/Objective This study examines how student assignment to elementary school classrooms is conditioned by teachers’ formal positions and intra-school social networks. We focus on the allocation of teachers to students; teachers are the major resource a school can allocate to influence educational opportunities. Population/Participants Data for this analysis are drawn from a larger study of school leadership and management in one public school district in the southeastern United States. In the 2006–2007 school year, the Cloverville district served 33,156 students, including 16,214 students at its 30 elementary schools. The final sample for our study included 309 teachers with at least 10 students, not including kindergarten and first grade students, in self-contained classrooms across 29 elementary schools in 2007 (one school was removed from the sample due to low response rates). Research Design This study is a longitudinal observational study that includes social network data and multiple regression analysis. We surveyed faculty two times in waves conducted in 2007 and 2008. Data Collection and Analysis The primary source of data was a survey that asked teachers to identify colleagues who provided them with advice and information about reading and mathematics instruction. The dependent variables in our analyses were class average language arts achievement in the spring of 2006, class average mathematics achievement in the spring of 2006, and class average free or reduced price lunch in the spring of 2006. We fit multiple regressions to estimate the extent to which non-random assignment of students to teachers was a function of teachers’ formal leadership positions and their collegial networks. Findings/Results We found teachers who provided more advice and information to their colleagues and who occupied formal leadership positions were assigned higher achieving students. Further, teachers who occupied formal leadership positions were less likely to be assigned students who received free or reduced price lunch. Conclusions/Recommendations Our study findings provide strong evidence that teachers who have more prominent positions in the formal organization of the school and in informal networks are assigned stronger students. Such non-random assignment of students to teachers can contribute to educational stratification.

AB  -  Objective: This article examines the effectiveness of remediation for community college students who are identified as having the lowest skills in math. Method: We use transcript data from a state community college system and take advantage of a regression discontinuity design that compares statistically identical students who are assigned to the lowest level of the math sequence that consists of three remedial courses versus the next lowest level that consists of two courses. Results: The results suggest that for the students with the lowest preparation in math, the longest developmental sequence offers little benefit and may even reduce the likelihood of earning a degree to certificate within 4 years. Contributions: This study is one of the first attempts to compare the academic outcomes of students assigned to long sequence of developmental math education to students with similar academic skills but assigned to shorter developmental math sequence. Results from this study can therefore help inform the national effort in reforming remedial education, especially in terms of whether shortening the long remedial sequence would either benefit or harm the academic outcomes of students who are least prepared for college-level coursework.

C2  - This study provides evidence studying one diverse, countywide district's integration efforts utilizing school choice and parental preferences. The findings illustrate substantial differences about the way in which the district's student assignment policy affects students. In particular, this choice-based integration policy with a weak geographic preference still advantages those who choose their nearest schools as well as white students and those living in more advantaged areas. Examining differences in families' school preferences, whether students are assigned to their preferred school, and whether and where students enroll in schools illustrates how an integration-focused assignment policy can still result in segregation and inequality. Yet, by illustrating the many influences on family preferences beyond proximity, it also suggests the opportunity for using assignment policy to overcome persistent neighborhood segregation.

C2  - Despite the overwhelming body of research suggesting that students with intellectual disability benefit from access to general education placements, students with intellectual disability continue to be educated primarily in segregated settings. Furthermore, the percentage of students with intellectual disability included in general education classrooms varies greatly among and within states across the United States. In an effort to explore such variability in New York State, we examined trends in general education placement rates of students with intellectual disability across districts and possible predictors of placement in regular classes. Results suggest that although descriptive patterns of placement exist, a more definitive explanation of variability requires a deeper analysis of policy and procedure at the district level.

AB  - Background/Context Disproportionate placement of African American students into special education programs is likely to be a form of institutional racism, especially when such placement stigmatizes students. If placement also fails to lead to educational benefits, the practice becomes even more suspect. Some studies have explored disproportionate placement (i.e., over-representation) from the perspectives of policy makers and educators, but few have looked at the practice from the vantage of the African American students experiencing it. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study This study explored how nine African American students in secondary special education placements perceived their school experiences and the benefits, challenges, and detriments associated with their placements and accompanying disability labels. Setting Participating students attended one of three high schools in an urban district in the midwestern United States. Respectively, the schools had low, medium, and high percentages of students on individualized education programs (IEPs). Population/Participants/Subjects Three students from each of three schools participated in the study. With the help of school personnel, the researchers selected students who (a) were African American, (b) were juniors or seniors, (c) carried the label of learning disabilities or mild cognitive impairment, and (d) had received special education services for at least three years. Research Design The researchers used an in-depth interview design including three increasingly detailed interviews with each student. Verbatim transcripts of interviews provided the data the researchers analyzed using (a) inductive coding, (b) development of case-specific profiles, (c) organization of codes to identify patterns in the data, and (d) identification of emergent themes. Findings/Results Three emergent themes suggested that, in most cases, students found the negative consequences of their special education placement to outweigh any benefits. The limited benefits of placement included interactions with responsive teachers and, in a few cases, more suitable instructional pacing. The negative consequences included the experience of being stigmatized by peers, making limited academic progress because of a slow-paced curriculum, and confronting barriers that kept them from returning to general education placements. Conclusions/Recommendations The study found that traumatic events in the students’ lives led to academic difficulties, which subsequently led to placement in special education. Rather than supporting the students through a difficult phase of their lives, educators used special education referral and placement as a form of victim blaming. This response had the effect of excluding the students from engagement with the general education curriculum and from interaction with friends. The dynamics of victim blaming led the researchers to judge special education referral and placement of the nine African American students as a form of institutional racism.

AB  -  We examine the impact of remedial and developmental courses on college students with varying levels of academic preparedness, thus focusing on a wider range of students than previous studies. Using a regression discontinuity design, we provide causal estimates of the effects of placement in different levels of remedial courses on short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes at both 2- and 4-year colleges. Similar to other research, we find that remediation has negative effects for students on the margin of needing one developmental course. However, for students with lower levels of academic preparation, the effects of remediation are estimated to be positive in some subjects. These results suggest that remedial courses can help or hinder students differently depending on their incoming levels of academic preparedness. Moreover, our conclusions are largely driven by positive and negative effects observed for students at 2-year institutions, and we discuss several hypotheses that may explain these findings.

C2  - Statewide policies can impact enrollment patterns of students. At one Texas University, 11th-grade Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills scores were predictive of success in students' first college-level mathematics course, but many students--those most at risk of failure--seem to have avoided taking a mathematics course in their first year at the institution. When placement accelerates a student's path through precollege-level sequences, it is not clear that the reduction of time to college-level coursework is concomitantly achieved. We recommend emphasizing the importance of completing mathematics courses early in students' academic careers.

AB  - Abstract
In 1975, federal law mandated that children with disabilities be educated in their least restrictive environment, or alongside peers without disabilities in general education classrooms to the maximum extent appropriate. More than 40 years later, I investigated how national trends in educational placement have changed over time for students with intellectual disability. Specifically, I examined the degree placements have trended toward less restrictive environments. I found historical trends of incremental progress toward less restrictive settings, but no evidence of such progress in recent years. Furthermore, most students were educated predominantly in segregated settings every year. I discuss how these findings relate to previous studies, as well as implications for individualized education program teams and advocates for educational inclusion.

C2  - In 2013, the Boston Public Schools (BPS) adopted the Home-Based Student Assignment Policy (HBSAP), which replaced elementary and middle-school choice within three large geographic zones with an algorithm that generates a choice basket of schools for each address based on proximity to the student's home and a guarantee that all baskets will include at least four schools in the top two state test-score quartiles of BPS. Adoption of HBSAP broke a long political stalemate. BPS invited broad public participation in the process but also shaped the agenda to favor what middle-class neighborhood participants wanted. The process obscured the zero-sum politics of student assignment by permitting current students and their younger siblings to continue in their schools after adoption of HBSAP and because the algorithm does not produce winners and losers as obviously as geographically defined student assignment policies do. BPS has not produced a comprehensive evaluation of HBSAP's effects, but early evidence suggests that it is making enclave schools more white.

AB  -  Objective: In recent years, developmental education (DE) reform has led to a restructuring of the placement process, redesigning of course instructional modalities, or implementing student support services to supplement developmental coursework. In Florida, recent legislative changes allowed students to opt out of placement testing and enroll directly in college-level courses regardless of academic ability. The purpose of this study is to understand how students’ high school transcript information can be used in the academic advising process when students are no longer required to take standardized placement tests. Method: We used a combination of high school courses from statewide student-level data and conducted logistic regression analyses to understand how these courses help predict success in English Composition 1 and Intermediate Algebra. We also developed student profiles and presented predicted probabilities to illustrate how students with different combinations of high school coursework were predicted to pass their courses. Results: The results indicated that, generally, when students enrolled in introductory college-level courses, those with higher levels of high school preparation were predicted to pass at higher rates. However, even students whose coursework designated them as college-ready had predicted passing rates of 69.5% in English and 47.6% in Intermediate Algebra. Contributions: We recommend that college academic advisors use high school coursework, in addition to other factors, when advising students into courses and that advisors support students’ success by referring them to appropriate support services. We call for additional research to further understand how high school coursework can be used for flexible placement policies.

AB  -  Student mobility and school discipline are two prominent challenges in urban school districts. The interaction of gender with school discipline in shaping patterns of student mobility has received little attention. This article examines student mobility patterns across gender and the timing of school changes in Clark County, Nevada. The findings draw attention to discipline-related mobility or the placement of students in alternative schools, especially during the school year. Male students are more likely to switch schools mid-year than female students, and the disproportionate rates of student mobility between male and female students can be explained by disciplinary incidents. Gender is a significant predictor of the destination school quality of discipline-related movers. Policy implications and areas for future research are discussed.

AB  -  Objective: Standardized placement tests remain the primary means by which new community college students are assessed and placed in the hierarchy of math and English coursework. A growing body of evidence indicates that placement tests tend to underestimate students’ likelihood of achieving passing grades in college-level courses, leading to students being misplaced in developmental coursework, slowing their academic progress, and increasing their likelihood of dropping out of college. This article discusses the results of a statewide research effort to improve the accuracy of student placement in math and English in the California Community College system. Method: Decision tree methods were applied to high school and college transcript data to identify key measures of high school achievement that predict performance in nine levels of community college math courses (three developmental and six college level) and four levels of community college English courses (three developmental and one college level). Results: Cumulative high school grade point average (GPA) is the most consistently useful predictor of performance across levels of math and English coursework, and a higher GPA is necessary to signal readiness for college-level coursework in math than is necessary to signal readiness for college-level coursework in English. In addition, cumulative GPA combined with specific indications of progress in the high school curriculum is frequently useful for predicting performance in math among direct matriculants and for predicting performance in both math and English among nondirect matriculants. Conclusion: Drawing on the findings, placement rules that colleges can apply directly in their placement processes are developed and validated.

C2  - Lack of access to general education for students with disabilities, particularly students with extensive support needs, students of color, and students from low-income households, reflects continued educational inequities for multiply marginalized students. Here, we present findings of a geospatial analysis of the intersections of race, socioeconomic status, disability labels, and levels of inclusion for students with disabilities in an urban school district, serving primarily students of color. Findings show trends in segregated placements mirroring historical redlining practices, suggesting the persistence of racial segregation that is enacted systematically and systemically via special education placements, disability categories, and geography. Results suggest the need to examine student-level placement data in the context of race, class, disability label, and space to identify and address inequities in access to inclusive schooling.

C2  - The purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analytic assessment of the effects of disciplinary alternative program (DAP) placement on student outcomes, including disciplinary sanctions, academic performance, and truancy. A total of 14 eligible studies were identified in peer-reviewed and grey literature, producing a total of 62 effect sizes. Five subgroup analyses were conducted. Results of the meta-analysis found an overall nonsignificant effect of DAP placement on student outcomes and subgroup analyses revealed differences in the effects of DAP placement by measurement time point and outcome type. Results of this study indicate DAP placement does not significantly improve student outcomes. This study emphasizes the need for rigorous methodological research examining the effect of DAP placement on adolescent delinquency.

AB  -  Schools differentially sort students into special education by race, though researchers debate the extent to which this is caused by racist school practices versus variation in student need due to other racial inequalities. I test the interaction between school-level racial composition and student-level race as a predictor of special education receipt. I find that as the proportion of White students increases, the risk of lower-status disabilities, such as intellectual disability, increases for Black, Latinx, and Native American students. As the proportion of White students decreases, White students’ risk of higher-status disabilities, such as speech/language impairment, increases relative to students of color. Thus, in the context of racial distinctiveness, student race becomes salient to sorting into special education.

C2  - This longitudinal study examines community college students' evolving perceptions on the value of developmental education. Through a series of semi-structured interviews, students described what they perceived of the advantages of beginning their college careers in developmental reading and writing classes. These advantages included becoming more skilled and confident writers, learning to read academically and for pleasure, and developing the ability to realistically assess their academic strengths and challenges. Additionally, students' initial perceptions of expediency as a marker of success evolved over time. Qualitative findings are juxtaposed against students' institutional records, which reveal positive outcomes in developmental coursework and credit-bearing English composition courses, but graduation rates that are consistent with those identified within larger-scale studies of developmental students in community college. Implications of these findings are considered in light of the burgeoning of accelerated workshop programs, aimed primarily at helping students circumvent developmental requirements and graduate as quickly as possible.

Students with the most significant disabilities continue to be taught in restrictive settings, despite accumulating evidence suggesting their special education services can be delivered effectively in general education settings. Every individualized education program (IEP) must contain a statement describing how the student will be provided a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment.

C2  - As a form of exclusionary discipline, student placement into an alternative learning program (ALP) may lead to negative outcomes for students (e.g., lower academic achievement, attrition, involvement in the juvenile justice system; Anderson and Ritter in Educ Policy Anal Arch 25(49):1-33, 2017). School counselors are called to address inequitable policies, procedures, and conditions that may limit students' personal/social and academic development, college access, and career readiness (ASCA, The ASCA national model: a framework for school counseling programs, 3rd edn. American School Counselor Association, Alexandria, VA, 2012). Additionally, school counselors should be unbiased in their decision-making (ASCA, Ethical standards for school counselors. American School Counselor Association, Alexandria, VA, 2016). The researchers utilized a true experimental design to examine the impact of student race (African American or White), gender (male or female), and socioeconomic status (SES; economically advantaged or disadvantaged) on practicing school counselors' (N = 334) decisions to place students in ALPs for disciplinary reasons. A factorial analysis of variance revealed no statistically significant differences in school counselors' likelihood of placing students in ALPs for disciplinary reasons based these student demographic factors. The study also revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between school counselors' belief in a just world, as measured by the Global Belief in a Just World Scale (GBJWS; Lipkus in Personal Individ Differ, 12(11): 1171--1178. https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(91)90081-L, 1991), and likelihood of referring students to ALPs for disciplinary reasons. Implications for school counselors and educational stakeholders are discussed.

C2  - This study investigates the link between basic math skills, remediation, and the educational opportunity and outcomes of community college students. Capitalizing on a unique placement policy in one community college that assigns students to remedial coursework based on multiple math skill cutoffs, I first identify the skills that most commonly inhibit student access to higher-level math courses; these are procedural fluency with fractions and the ability to solve word problems. I then estimate the impact of &quot;just missing&quot; these skill cutoffs using multiple rating-score regression discontinuity design. Missing just one fractions question on the placement diagnostic, and therefore starting college in a lower-level math course, had negative effects on college persistence and attainment. Missing other skill cutoffs did not have the same impacts. The findings suggest the need to reconsider the specific math expectations that regulate access to college math coursework.

AB  - Background Ability grouping has resurged in U.S. schools despite long-standing debates over its consequences for educational equity. Proponents argue that it is the best response to variation in academic skills because it allows teachers to customize the content and pace of instruction to students’ diverse needs. Critics answer that this practice places students in divergent educational paths that reproduce educational and social inequalities. Despite the contested nature of ability grouping, research has yet to produce reliable longitudinal evidence to evaluate critics’ claims. Objective We examine the degree to which exposure to within-class grouping for reading instruction from kindergarten to third grade is predictive of students’ reading test scores and English coursework in the middle grades. Research Design We use multilevel achievement growth models predicting average reading achievement from kindergarten to eighth grade as a function of years of exposure in low, average, or high ability groups in kindergarten through third grade and control variables relevant to each grade. We evaluate the achievement differences between students who are grouped in these ability groups for one or more years and those who were never ability grouped. We use multinomial logistic regression models to estimate the degree to which number of years in each ability group in K–3 grades predicts placements in eighth-grade English classes (below grade or honors, as opposed to regular English classes). Data We use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS–K), a national panel study of the 1998 U.S. kindergarten cohort sponsored by National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education. Our sample consists of 7,800 students with data for fall of kindergarten, and spring of kindergarten and first, third, fifth, and eighth grades. Findings Compared with similar students who were ungrouped in the early grades, those in high-ability reading groups have higher test scores, whereas those in low-ability groups have lower test scores in every grade from kindergarten to the eighth grade. In addition, compared with their ungrouped counterparts, students in low-ability groups in the early grades are more likely to enroll in eighth grade English classes that are below grade level, whereas those in high-ability groups in these grades are more likely to enroll in honors eighth-grade English classes. Achievement gaps between previously grouped and ungrouped students increase with every additional year of exposure to ability grouping. Conclusions Students’ ability group placements in the early grades evolve into divergent educational paths that grow further apart with multiple years of grouping. These findings provide the first longitudinal evidence linking ability grouping to the reproduction of educational inequalities.

C2  - Background: Ability grouping has resurged in U.S. schools despite long-standing debates over its consequences for educational equity. Proponents argue that it is the best response to variation in academic skills because it allows teachers to customize the content and pace of instruction to students' diverse needs. Critics answer that this practice places students in divergent educational paths that reproduce educational and social inequalities. Despite the contested nature of ability grouping, research has yet to produce reliable longitudinal evidence to evaluate critics' claims. Objective: We examine the degree to which exposure to within-class grouping for reading instruction from kindergarten to third grade is predictive of students' reading test scores and English coursework in the middle grades. Research Design: We use multilevel achievement growth models predicting average reading achievement from kindergarten to eighth grade as a function of years of exposure in low, average, or high ability groups in kindergarten through third grade and control variables relevant to each grade. We evaluate the achievement differences between students who are grouped in these ability groups for one or more years and those who were never ability grouped. We use multinomial logistic regression models to estimate the degree to which number of years in each ability group in K-3 grades predicts placements in eighth-grade English classes (below grade or honors, as opposed to regular English classes). Data: We use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a national panel study of the 1998 U.S. kindergarten cohort sponsored by National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education. Our sample consists of 7,800 students with data for fall of kindergarten, and spring of kindergarten and first, third, fifth, and eighth grades. Findings: Compared with similar students who were ungrouped in the early grades, those in high-ability reading groups have higher test scores, whereas those in low-ability groups have lower test scores in every grade from kindergarten to the eighth grade. In addition, compared with their ungrouped counterparts, students in low-ability groups in the early grades are more likely to enroll in eighth grade English classes that are below grade level, whereas those in high-ability groups in these grades are more likely to enroll in honors eighth-grade English classes. Achievement gaps between previously grouped and ungrouped students increase with every additional year of exposure to ability grouping. Conclusions: Students' ability group placements in the early grades evolve into divergent educational paths that grow further apart with multiple years of grouping. These findings provide the first longitudinal evidence linking ability grouping to the reproduction of educational inequalities.

AB  -  Objective: Although immigrant students placed in English as a Second Language (ESL) sequence at community colleges are a growing student population, there is a dearth of research focused on these students in college. This study provides descriptive estimates of community college students’ progression through the credit-earning ESL sequence and disaggregates the findings by Generation 1.5/2.0 status. As community colleges seek to better support students whose primary language is not English, this study provides some of the first empirical evidence on who is placing where and how long it takes students to progress through the ESL sequence. Method: This study uses transcript data from a community college in California that enrolls a large proportion of students in the ESL sequence and estimates a Cox proportional hazards model with time to completing English 101 as the dependent variable. Results: Most Generation 1.5/2.0 students who take the ESL placement test start three levels or below college-level English. Furthermore, Generation 1.5/2.0 students attempt and complete English 101 at a lower rate than international students. Results from the Cox proportional hazards model show that international students are more likely to complete English 101 than U.S. citizens at any given point in time. Among the Generation 1.5/2.0 subsample, female permanent residents are more likely to complete English 101 than citizens. Conclusion: The findings suggest a need to reassess the ESL placement process so that all students placed in ESL are able to successfully progress toward college-level English.

C2  - Previous research on remediation has examined course placement practices, but little is known about first responders and how their beliefs about proper course placements help maintain patterns in course access. This study examined how taken-for-granted racial beliefs were used as legitimate knowledge by community college counselors. Haney LÃ³pez's (2000) race as commonsense theoretical perspective was used to analyze interview data from 34 counselors in 2 southern California community colleges. Data showed that counselors recreated race categories and racial hierarchy, and they did so by reinforcing beliefs about white students as intelligent and deserving higher placements and Latina/o students as comparatively lower in ability and deserving remediation. The results suggest that counselors begin institutionalizing racial sorting immediately as first-time students begin to enroll. The findings highlight the importance of racial mindfulness in policy, practice, and research.

C2  - Response to Intervention (RtI) is a multitiered system of support, designed to improve student learning outcomes and early identification of struggling students. Much attention has been paid to RtI for literacy at the elementary level, but less on RtI for mathematics at the secondary level. The current case study examines one high school's implementation of an RtI program in mathematics. The main results included the inconsistent rate of growth across students in the RtI mathematics classes and the lack of a statistically significant relationship between tier status and rate of improvement; the inconsistent implementation of a general theorized RtI for mathematics model; and the perceived greatest benefit by students of the Tier 2 math class appeared to be the two certified mathematics teachers.

C2  - Academic underpreparedness is an issue for many first-time-in-college students, particularly those entering community colleges. Whereas many underprepared students enroll in developmental education, research has indicated that traditional remediation may not increase students' chances for success. Therefore, states and colleges have begun to implement new course placement strategies to increase the accuracy of initial course placement and new instructional approaches to better serve their developmental students. Specifically, in 2013, the state of Florida passed Senate Bill 1720 which redesigned developmental coursework and placement policies across the Florida College System. The reform lifted developmental education placement exam testing and course enrollment requirements for certain exempt students, irrespective of prior academic preparation or achievement. The current study focuses on these exempt students--those who had the option to bypass developmental education--who were also underprepared, and their initial course selection and subsequent success in their gateway (introductory college-level) English course. Using statewide student-level data and logistic regression techniques, the results indicated that level of preparation was related to students' course enrollment and gateway English course success. Students slightly underprepared in reading or writing were more likely than severely underprepared students to enroll in the gateway English class, relative to a developmental reading or writing course. In reading and writing, slightly underprepared students were more likely to pass English, relative to severely underprepared students. The authors consider the findings in light of recent national changes to developmental education and offer recommendations for policy and practice.

AB  - In this article, Todd Grindal, Laura Schifter, Gabriel Schwartz, and Thomas Hehir examine race/ethnicity differences in students' special education identification and subsequent placement in segregated educational settings. Using individual-level data on the full population of K–12 public school students in three states, the authors find that racial and ethnic disparities in identification persist within income categories and are stronger for those disabilities that are typically identified in a school setting, such as learning disabilities or emotional disabilities, than those more often identified by a health-care provider, such as blindness or deafness. Also, Black and Hispanic students with disabilities were more likely to be placed in a substantially separate setting, compared to white students, regardless of income status. These results suggest that low-income status is insufficient to explain observed inequalities in the rate at which students of color are identified for special education and placed in substantially separate settings. A better understanding of the ways income status and race contribute to students' interactions with the special education system are critical for building a more equitable and just K–12 education system.

C2  - After reviewing curriculum materials and observing instructional practices, the author identified trends and issues in school districts related to the implementation of differentiated curriculum and stakeholders' views. Although primary stakeholders hold positive views of a differentiated curriculum, limited differentiation is being used in the regular curriculum. When teachers used differentiated curriculum, they were quite effective in the fidelity of implementation. However, principals appeared to be disinterested in differentiating the general curriculum and left its implementation to the discretion of teachers and the gifted coordinator, and superintendents were more focused on differentiation strategies for all learners and the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the gifted program. Moreover, the implementation of differentiation was influenced by the type of grouping and concerns about student performance on the state test. The author concluded with a discussion of remedies to administrative perceptions about gifted curriculum and grouping models.

This article uses the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study of 2011 to explore whether the use of readiness assessments for such purpose predicts differential sorting of students across classrooms by prior academic ability. Results from multilevel models as well as other sensitivity analyses suggest that the use of readiness assessments for classroom placements is predictive of slightly higher cross-class ability sorting, particularly in English/language arts.

C2  - This article argues that the national trend to replace developmental writing programs with mainstreaming and corequisite courses presents an important opportunity to reconsider writing goals and assessment practices for all students. This insight emerges in part from data collected over several semesters at one community college, which showed that mainstreamed students in an accelerated learning program often outperform non-developmental students when assessed by the same measure. These results raise questions about placement but also about prior assessment practices that had required developmental students to undergo more rigorous writing assessments than students deemed &quot;prepared&quot; for college-level writing. By offering a history of shifting assessment practices at one institution, this article aims to show how blurring the line between &quot;developmental&quot; and &quot;regular&quot; writers, as a result of recent mainstreaming efforts, can lead to a productive reevaluation of writing assessment for all students.

AB  - Background/Context Many schools no longer track classes to increase access to courses at all levels, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. However, informal processes can “de facto” track students, placing them at the same level across subjects. Research shows that de facto tracking is prevalent in STEM, especially between mathematics and science course placements. Less is known about the relationship between mathematics and engineering—the focus of this study. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study Mathematics placement is likely to shape participation in engineering given its position under the STEM umbrella. Yet, de facto tracking does not occur all the time. This may depend on the categorization of courses as “academic” or “vocational,” but there is little research about this aspect of course-to-student matching. Therefore, we investigate an unexpected case of equitable participation where mathematics placement does not de facto track students in engineering. We ask: How do institutional and organizational factors shape the absence of de facto tracking? Research Design We used qualitative data drawn from a two-year mixed-methods study in a public high school district with one large comprehensive high school. The school is in the lower third of per pupil spending in the state of Massachusetts, yet has significant engineering-related course offerings. Located near Boston, it serves an economically and racially diverse student body of ∼1,800 students. For this article, we analyzed 998 hours of observations during and after school, in engineering-related elective courses and extracurricular activities, and interviews with 29 students, 31 teachers, six guidance counselors, two district administrators, and the principal. Findings/Results We find competing vocational and academic logics equally frame engineering, which we call “institutional ambiguity.” This dual framing is present at the institutional level and is supported at the school level by three organizational factors: 1) courses and activities that occur in both vocational and academic spaces, 2) teachers who link vocational and academic fields, and 3) an organizational commitment to support the integration of vocational activities. Conclusions/Recommendations Overall, this article contributes to educational and organizational research by identifying the institutional factors and organizational processes that shape the categorization of courses and student-to-course matching. Our research reveals the conditions under which schools and the actors within them have greater agency, where ambiguity in the broader environment allows for contestation and renegotiation of status hierarchies. We argue that by leveraging ambiguity, schools may avoid contributing to inequity in STEM.

Located near Boston, it serves an economically and racially diverse student body of ~1,800 students. For this article, we analyzed 998 hours of observations during and after school, in engineering-related elective courses and extracurricular activities, and interviews with 29 students, 31 teachers, six guidance counselors, two district administrators, and the principal. Findings/Results: We find competing vocational and academic logics equally frame engineering, which we call &quot;institutional ambiguity.&quot; This dual framing is present at the institutional level and is supported at the school level by three organizational factors: 1) courses and activities that occur in both vocational and academic spaces, 2) teachers who link vocational and academic fields, and 3) an organizational commitment to support the integration of vocational activities. Conclusions/Recommendations: Overall, this article contributes to educational and organizational research by identifying the institutional factors and organizational processes that shape the categorization of courses and student-to-course matching. Our research reveals the conditions under which schools and the actors within them have greater agency, where ambiguity in the broader environment allows for contestation and renegotiation of status hierarchies. We argue that by leveraging ambiguity, schools may avoid contributing to inequity in STEM.

AB  -  This study examines the impact of a “natural experiment” that gave students the choice to place into or out of developmental math because of an unintended mistake made by a community college. During self-placement, more students chose to enroll in gateway college- and transfer-level math courses, however, greater proportions of female, Black, and Hispanic students enrolled in the lowest levels of math relative to test-placed counterparts. Difference-in-difference estimates show that self-placement led to positive outcomes, but mostly for White, Asian, and male students. This evidence suggests areas of concern and potential for improvement for self-placement policies. Self-determination theory, behavioral decision theory, and stereotype vulnerability provide possible explanations for the observed changes.

C2  - We used a qualitative case study approach to examine the schooling experiences of 40 current high school seniors and 20 alumni from an urban STEAM career academy comprised of 98% African American students from low-income families. Using tracking as a theoretical lens, we found that students in the high school STEAM career academy were stratified using a more modern, dual system approach - and were labeled as traditional and college preparatory. These schooling practices led to the traditional tracked students being treated as second class citizens as well as being denied access to high-quality curricula to prepare them to be college and career ready. Based on our findings, we recommend that school personnel customize curricula based on the interests of students and enable them all to participate in college preparatory activities as well as work-based learning experiences.

C2  - Gatekeeper courses such as Anatomy and Physiology are often referenced in discussions regarding the national shortage of persons in allied health professions. In an attempt to bolster access to STEM professions, some community colleges are mandating prerequisite courses such as Natural Sciences and/or General Biology for STEM gatekeeping courses. In this study, we examined which of these prerequisite courses helped students to pass Anatomy and Physiology and whether the courses are an additional barrier to STEM field completion. This was the first study to evaluate whether a prerequisite course was predictive of success in Anatomy and Physiology, and it contributes to the body of literature regarding student success in the sciences.

AB  -  Research on college admissions shows that all students tend to benefit from overmatching, but high-status students are most likely to be overmatched, and low-status students are most likely to be undermatched. This study examines whether mismatching takes place when students are sorted into classrooms in middle school. Given prior research on effectively maintained inequality, we theorize that classroom sorting acts as an opportunity for privileged parents to obtain a qualitative advantage for their children. Our research uses administrative data from Indiana and hierarchical linear models to analyze classroom mismatch in sixth through eighth grades. We find that privileged students are more likely to be overmatched in both math and English language arts (ELA) classrooms but that overmatching is beneficial in math but detrimental in ELA. This suggests that inequality can be effectively maintained only if parents have an accurate understanding of what constitutes an advantage.

C2  - This study aims to examine the representation of African American males in AP, honors, and gifted courses in secondary education. The current investigation represents a causal-comparative investigation of 2017-2020 school district data from a large metropolitan school district regarding the number of African American males selected for inclusion in gifted and/or AP studies. This study's significance is to bring to the forefront a systemic practice within public schools, which has served to permanently deny African American males their ability to achieve academically at their level. Findings support that there is a lack of African American students currently enrolled in advanced coursework. The furtherance of current practices prolongs the systemic denial of this population of students' access to opportunities to excel in their educational opportunities.

C2  - Developmental mathematics, which is designed to prepare students for college-level mathematics courses, can be a barrier to students' success. In the United States, the majority of students placed into developmental mathematics courses fail to complete the developmental sequence. Alternative mathematics pathways offer some benefits when integrated with &quot;just-in- time support&quot; or expedited instruction on specific prerequisite concepts needed solely for the current lesson. This study compares two statistics courses taught at a public community college: a complete course taught in one semester and a two-semester version with just-in-time develop- mental content integrated into the course. The study found that students placed into the one- semester statistics course accumulated significantly more credits after one and two years of college. These students also completed an associate's degree within two years at a significantly higher rate than students placed into the two-semester statistics course. The study also found students deemed non-proficient by the college's placement exam, who also had a strong high school average were significantly more likely to earn a grade of A- or higher or a grade of B- or higher compared to students originally deemed proficient.

C2  - Ensuring that test-score use brings about socially positive consequences for test-takers is an important aspect of test validation. While many studies use an inductive approach to evaluate test consequences, few studies have implemented Appraisal analysis. To that end, this case study investigated the test consequences of an English reading placement test that was administered at a large American university. In this study, English as a second language (ESL) students (n=8) who took the placement test and an ESL reading course were interviewed; an Appraisal analysis was conducted to identify the students' positive and/or negative perceptions toward the placement test and the ESL reading course. Using an argument-based approach to validity framework, the findings were treated as evidence to evaluate the test consequences of the placement test. The results showed that, while taking the ESL course helped students gain some valuable academic reading skills, students felt that test anxiety, fatigue, and verbally demanding questions hindered their test performances. Understanding what students experienced while taking the test can help test-developers devise solutions that will improve the test-taking situation for future test-takers. This study also illustrates how an Appraisal analysis of test-takers' discourses can provide a systematic and fine-grained approach to evaluating positive and/or negative test consequences.

AB  - Racial segregation has been an ongoing issue in American education and one of the leading contributors to the racial achievement gap. Prior to the Brown v. Board decision of 1954, Black Americans were legally relegated to substandard schools and educational opportunities. Post-Brown, racial segregation continues to manifest as a result of de facto segregation and second-generation segregation. Moreover, the predominantly White teaching force – a negative consequence of desegregation – has been linked to poorer outcomes for Black and Latino students. Our study examines trends in racially disproportionate assignment of Black and Latino students to less experienced teachers than their White counterparts. Specifically, our analysis illustrates statistically significant trends in the assignment of less experienced teachers to Black and Latino students in middle school math over several years. This analysis contributes to the recent research phenomenon of measuring the cumulative pattern of racially disproportionate teacher-student assignments over time as a particularly effective means of understanding the effects of systematic and sustained inequalities on academic achievement. Across several grades and content areas of instruction, we found that the race of students was related to the teaching experience of their teachers. Our findings illustrate the negative impacts of racial segregation on students of color and supports the need for more intervention and administrative intentions regarding teacher-student assignments and racial equity in schools.

C2  - As public school student demographics continue to diversify, the employment of multicultural education pedagogy in special education becomes ever more critical. Multicultural education pedagogy supports the placement of special education pre-service teachers (SEPSTs) in culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) field placements; yet scholars warn field placements have the potential to reinforce deficit-centered perceptions. Therefore, this pilot study sought to examine SEPSTs perceptions of students who are CLD and their educational needs in response to placement in CLD field experience through interviews with three SEPSTs in one teacher preparation program (TPP). Findings align with previous work in the field, underscoring the importance of critical reflection and the alignment of multicultural content in required coursework. Future research and implications for teacher preparation are also discussed.

C2  - Student placement test records, course enrollments, and other student-level data collected by community colleges are vital for evaluating the outcomes of students in developmental education (dev-ed) courses. Researchers and policymakers rely on this information to examine the impact of existing programs and assess ongoing reforms to dev-ed -- the accuracy of state administrative data is critical to those tasks. In this study, we examine math placement records in a statewide administrative data set to understand how test records provided by colleges in the state aligned with student course enrollment patterns. We highlight systematic data reporting problems, where many students lacked test scores and test exemption records necessary for policymakers and researchers to determine if they enrolled in the appropriate coursework for their needs. We also found that a non-negligible proportion of students enrolled in dev-ed math -- 10% -- did not require remediation due to exemption status or passing placement test scores. We conclude with a discussion of the pressing need for accuracy in data reporting, as up-to-date, high-quality student-level data are essential to evaluate ongoing reforms to developmental education.

AB  -  It is important to understand how longitudinal patterns of special education placement differ from cross-sectional incidence estimates in order to improve measurement precision and better target assistance to students with disabilities. This study used latent class growth analysis in a national-level data set to classify four trajectories of special education service receipt from kindergarten to eighth grade (Never, Persistent, Delayed, and Discontinued) and to predict which kindergarteners follow these trajectories of service receipt ( N = 3,970). This study is among the first to identify which kindergarteners with disabilities may experience persistent special education services, which may exit special education, and what patterns of sociodemographic, achievement, and behavior covariates distinguish these groups. Results both align with prior work and offer a fresh perspective for researchers and policymakers as to how placement changes across schooling and for whom.

AB  -  Over half of community college students place into developmental education, resulting in significant financial costs. We extend previous research demonstrating that using placement tests to assign students into developmental courses results in frequent misplacement. We use Florida data to explore the extent to which students are misplaced into their first college course by more than one level. Results suggest that moving away from placement tests and toward other metrics (like high school grade point average [GPA]) may not be as beneficial in Florida as was demonstrated in prior studies. Rather, it may be preferable to choose cutoffs that minimize misplacement than to use new metrics. States should consider their own unique contexts and examine whether they can improve placement accuracy by changing cut scores.

C2  - Access to general education settings for students with disabilities varies greatly among and within states across the United States and worldwide. The variability in placement and lack of access to general education for students with disabilities, particularly students with extensive support needs, are reasons to identify factors associated with placement and then address the role of current policy. Explored in this study were the placement of students with extensive support needs in 938 school districts across the State of California in the United States and the relationship between placement and economic and demographic factors. Results suggest alarmingly low access to general education classrooms for students with extensive support needs, significant variability in placement, and relationships between placement and factors, such as total enrollment, race, and expenditure.

C2  - Based on data from an ethnographic study of teachers, the author applies analytical tools from critical race theory to make sense of how teachers made decisions about classroom placement in an elementary school in the U.S. South. The article is organized around the questions, In what ways did teachers in this study make sense of race in classroom placement decisions? What implications might this have for teachers and teacher education? Findings are organized and analyzed in three sections: the melting pot framework; legit, mixed, and others; and everybody needs to be put in a box. The author provides specific recommendations for making race-visible classroom placement decisions and shares implications for the role of teacher education in preparing teachers to make race-visible decisions

C2  - Federal law under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Improvement Act stipulates that services provided to students with diagnosed disabilities must be (a) individualised based on the assessed needs of each student and (b) include the fewest restrictions necessary to achieve students' personalised goals. However, determining the level of service and educational placement best suited to each student can be challenging. Recent legal rulings are also placing increased pressure on schools to provide services that yield substantive achievement. The following study examines the relation between time spent in general education settings and outcomes on state assessments. Results indicate a significant positive association between time spent in general education and scaled scores on state assessments for reading and math; no association was found for alternative state assessments. Ethical and practical implications as well as recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  -  In the wake of political and legal challenges facing race-based integration, districts have turned to socioeconomic integration initiatives in an attempt to achieve greater racial balance across schools. Empirically, the extent to which these initiatives generate such balance is an open question. In this article, we leverage the school assignment system that the Wake County Public School System employed throughout the 2000s to provide evidence on this issue. Although our results show that Wake County Public School System’s socioeconomic-based assignment policy had negligible effects on average levels of segregation across the district, it substantially reduced racial segregation for students who would have attended majority-minority schools under a residence-based assignment policy. The policy also exposed these students to peers with different racial/ethnic backgrounds, higher mean achievement levels, and more advantaged neighborhood contexts. We explore how residential context and details of the policy interacted to produce this pattern of effects and close the article by discussing the implications of our results for research and policy.

AB  - Background/Context Federal laws require equitable access to education for students with disabilities through educational placement in the least restrictive environment (LRE). However, research has determined students with significant support needs (SSN) are overrepresented in segregated educational placements. Focus of Study This study explores justifications of LRE placement decisions for students with SSN through a critical qualitative analysis. We evaluated how individualized education program (IEP) teams interpret LRE and justify placement decisions for students with SSN. Additionally, we sought to understand how the interpretation of LRE permits or restricts access to general education for students with SSN. Population Students with SSN are those who require support across multiple domains and often have disabilities in the categories of autism, intellectual disability, multiple disabilities, and deaf-blindness. Research Design We used a qualitative methodology situated in a critical geography framework. Data were derived from the LRE statements found in IEPs of students with SSN. Each statement included in this study was used to identify the three power relationship spaces derived from critical geography theory: utopia, dystopia, and heterotopia. Findings Three types of placement decisions were identified. Students with SSN were most often offered conditional placements and less frequently closed or open placements. Rationales for LRE decisions revealed barriers to accessing general education contexts related to hidden power dynamics, attempts to maintain social norms, and the use of ambiguous terminology. Data analysis also revealed that LRE justifications generate special education heterotopias that create illusive access to the general education context and content for students with SSN. Conclusions/Recommendations The application of critical theory assists in understanding the continued overrepresentation of students with SSN in placements that limit access to general education. Findings from this study suggest the discontinuation of the continuum of special education placements to dismantle the inequitable structures of special education for students with SSN.

AB  -  The least restrictive environment (LRE) mandate suggests a preference for educating students with disabilities in general education settings provided their needs can be met there. This study examined national trends in the educational placements of students with disabilities ages 6 to 17 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1990 through 2015. Data were retrieved electronically from the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Census Bureau websites. Cumulative placement rates were then calculated. Findings indicate that from 1990 through 2015, (a) general education placements increased while more restrictive placements decreased, (b) students in secondary schools continued to be placed in more restrictive settings, and (c) the impact of disability categories on national LRE trends varied. Future research is needed to investigate the effect of increased identification rates in specific disability categories on national placement trends and explore how placement practices vary across schools, districts, and states.

AB  - AbstractHow should schools assign students to more rigorous math courses so as best to help their academic outcomes? We identify several hundred California middle schools that used 7th‐grade test scores to place students into 8th‐grade algebra courses and use a regression discontinuity design to estimate average impacts and heterogeneity across schools. Enrolling in 8th‐grade algebra boosts students’ enrollment in advanced math in ninth grade by 30 percentage points and eleventh grade by 16 percentage points. Math scores in tenth grade rise by 0.05 standard deviations. Women, students of color, and English‐language learners benefit disproportionately from placement into early algebra. Importantly, the benefits of 8th‐grade algebra are substantially larger in schools that set their eligibility threshold higher in the baseline achievement distribution. This suggests a potential tradeoff between increased access and rates of subsequent math success.

AB  - AbstractWith this study we examined with a sample ofN = 102 primary-school teachers whether their use of information about students’ achievement development for placement recommendations depended on student ethnicity. We applied student vignettes to mimic real students, and orthogonally varied student ethnicity, their GPA development, suggested by their last two school reports in primary school, and their grand mean of grades. We found that students were more likely to be recommended for the highest track when their grand mean of grades indicated higher achievements and when their GPA improved rather than declined. Moreover, we found strong evidence that teachers applied ethnic stereotypes when making school-placement recommendations. If the students fitted an ethnic stereotype, teachers tend to ignore information about their achievement development, whereas if the students did not fit an ethnic stereotype, teachers’ judgments were rather based on all information that was provided about the students. Hence, achievement development was less important for school-placement recommendations when students were stereotyped than when they were not stereotyped. Implications of the results were discussed.

This study utilizes a correlational–multiple regression design to investigate the efficacy of one such measure of socioeconomic/racial diversity, the diversity index (DI) of Jefferson County Public Schools, in predicting the aggregate academic achievement of students within a school. Moreover, this study seeks to compare the relative efficacy of the DI with other common measures of socioeconomic and racial diversity analogous to component factors of the DI. Metrics such as the DI provide an opportunity for researchers to better understand the intersections of poverty and race as well as their relationship with academic achievement.

C2  - The least restrictive environment (LRE) is the legal right for students with disabilities to be included and educated with their non-disabled peers. However, at a fundamental level, LRE can be misinterpreted and measured inconsistently, creating a contentious environment for some schools and families of students with special needs. In the current study, using descriptive content analysis, special education due process hearings in the State of California over a five-year period available through the Office of Administrative Hearings were examined in order to identify characteristics of the students involved in LRE litigation and trends of LRE cases across the years. Results revealed that students involved in LRE-related hearings were mostly male, English-speaking, and classified as having a special education eligibility category of autism. An increase in general education placement was shown, and a decrease in home-hospital instruction. Future directions and implications for the implementation of LRE for school psychologists and special education teams are discussed.

AB  - In response to the Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education Supreme Court decision, Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) reconfigured the district’s race-based student assignment and implemented a race- and socioeconomic-based student assignment plan. Using hierarchical linear multiple regression, this study examined students’ backgrounds and school composition factors within a race- and socioeconomic-based assignment plan to determine their relationship with college and career readiness as measured by the ACT. We found that student race, participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), ACT PLAN performance, school composition, and neighborhood category were the largest and most consistent factors for predicting college and career readiness. African American students were at a disadvantage in each model compared with White students. Participation in NSLP was negatively associated with student performance compared with non-NSLP students, and PLAN scores positively predicted ACT performance. School composition was found negatively associated with ACT performance (Title I compared with non–Title I schools), and Category 1 and Category 2 neighborhoods were negatively associated with ACT scores compared with Category 3 neighborhoods. We conclude by discussing implications for policy, practice, and future research.

C2  - Nonideal enrollment of nonbiology majors into biology majors courses serves as an impediment to academic success and negatively impacts rates of college course completion. In this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved investigation, we examine student success, as measured by student grades and course completion rates, for nonbiology majors who nonideally enroll in biology majors and allied health courses. We compare their achievements with biology majors and allied health students enrolled in courses specifically designed for biology majors and those who pursue allied health paths, and with nonbiology majors who appropriately take biology courses designed for nonmajors. We show that under these circumstances, nonmajors perform worse in majors and allied health courses compared to their peers who enroll in the correct courses. In addition, our study shows that nonmajors have significantly higher attrition rates when enrolled in biology majors and allied health courses. Strategies to guide students and prevent nonideal course registration are discussed in the context of the Achieving the Dream (AtD) initiative, which uses a data-driven approach.

C2  - Using linked, individual-level data from a large metropolitan K-12 district and a large urban community college district in California, we examine whether indicators of college-readiness for graduating high school students who were initially classified as English Learners (ELs) are honored in community college course placement. In particular, we explore (1) whether there is misalignment in course assignment levels among former EL students between the K-12 and community college sector based on high school readiness metrics; and (2) if misalignment exists, we investigate its extent among various levels and identities of EL students. We employ an integrated capitals and funds of knowledge framework to emphasize students' assets in the form of resources, knowledge, and skills while also acknowledging the role of education systems in reproducing social inequities. We find that along with students who speak Spanish at home, Latina/o, and Black students, former ELs who met college-readiness standards experienced the highest levels of inter-sector English misalignment (over 75%). Our results show a negative association between experiencing inter-sector misalignment and college credit accumulation. After controlling for course placement, background, and academic characteristics our analysis suggests that despite facing higher levels of inter-sector misalignment relative to other students, former ELs manage to accumulate five to six more transferable degree units than their monolingual English-speaking peers. The findings suggest a need for even greater inter-sector communication and accountability between legislators, K-12, and postsecondary leaders to ensure that state-level college-readiness standards are properly defined and consistently used in the transition from high school to college.

C2  - Limited attention has been placed on the relationship between developmental math and STEM outcomes in community college. We therefore examine one particular experience during the transition from high school to college called math misalignment, which occurs when college students are placed lower in math than is warranted given their high-school course-taking history and record of achievement. Drawing on analysis of linked high school and community college student records, we find that a majority of students in the study sample experienced math misalignment in community college. Moreover, math misalignment especially hindered STEM-aspiring students from pursuing STEM pathways. STEM-aspiring students who experienced math misalignment were less likely to complete STEM courses than STEM-aspiring students who were directly placed in transfer-level math. This study underscores the importance of aligning academic standards across high-school and postsecondary institutions as a means of improving STEM participation.

C2  - Ability grouping is a common practice in elementary mathematics instruction, but some research suggests that grouping by ability can exacerbate existing inequities, and there is evidence that alternatives to grouping can improve learning experiences for all students. In this paper, we describe an effort to support teachers in using equitable teaching practices that was part of an Elementary Mathematics Specialist (EMS) certification program at a public university in the United States. We employ multiple perspectives in our collaborative action research approach: the first author was the director of the EMS program, the second author was a graduate researcher working to support the program, and the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth authors were all teachers in the program. We start by introducing efforts to address equity from the perspective of program designers, including specific activities used during a Summer Institute to prompt consideration of alternatives to ability grouping. Then we share several experiences of reducing ability grouping from the perspectives of four teachers who were participants in the program, noting successes and challenges. We conclude with implications for research and practice.

C2  - Traditionally colleges have relied on standalone non-credit-bearing developmental education (DE) to support students academically and ensure readiness for college-level courses. As emerging evidence has raised concerns about the effectiveness of DE courses, colleges and states have been experimenting with approaches that place students into credit-bearing coursework more quickly. To better understand which types of students might be most likely to benefit from being placed into college-level math coursework, this study examines heterogeneity in the causal effects of placement into college-level courses using a regression discontinuity design and administrative data from the state of Texas. We focus on student characteristics that are related to academic preparation or might signal a student's likelihood of success or need for additional support and might therefore be factors considered for placement into college-level courses under &quot;holistic advising&quot; or &quot;multiple measures&quot; initiatives. We find heterogeneity in outcomes for many of the measures we examined. Students who declared an academic major designation, had bachelor's degree aspirations, tested below college readiness on multiple subjects, were designated as Limited English Proficiency (LEP), and/or were economically disadvantaged status were more likely to benefit from placement into college-level math. Part-time enrollment or being over the age of 21 were associated with reduced benefits from placement into college-level math. We do not find any heterogeneity in outcomes for our high school achievement measure, three or more years of math taken in high school. [For the corresponding grantee submission, see ED613729.]

AB  -  Curricular tracking is common in many countries, yet this school practice might have unintended consequences for students’ attitudes toward school. We examined the changes in adolescents’ school belonging among sixth graders placed in honors versus regular math, with academic identity as a mediator in this relation. Early adolescents ( N = 322; 72% White; 164 girls) in the southeastern United States completed measures of school belonging and academic identity at the beginning and end of their sixth-grade year. With parent education, prior math achievement, and prior school belonging controlled, honors math placement predicted increases in school belonging from the beginning to the end of students’ sixth-grade year, and this association was positively mediated by academic identity. Results of this study are important for further understanding the influences of tracking on students’ motivational beliefs.

Quantitative results showed significant increases in students’ standardized state test scores when moved to the upper high school mathematical track. Quantitative results also indicate that the inclusion of these students did not affect those previously tracked. Qualitative results provide support for school personnel in understanding the effects of teacher expectations on student outcomes. Results inform and support researchers and policy makers to reconsider beliefs about tracking.

C2  - In this case study, we use organizational development and change theory to look at how the University of Oklahoma (OU) has attended to the mathematical pathway leading to STEM fields. Using multiple sources of data, we are able to create an informative narrative that provides the particular context of the situation and in-depth picture of the campus response, including key changes and ongoing challenges that were noted over a five-year period. Through the use of both internal and external funding, OU has been able to improve its teaching and learning in the STEM mathematical pathway. OU has also been able to develop a First-Year Mathematics program based on national recommendations. We report how efforts have directly impacted hiring, placement, pedagogical methods, course coordination, TA training, as well as the collection and use of data in decision making.

C2  - In the continual pursuit of classroom learning effectiveness, researchers and educators aim to develop strategies that improve student performance and learning. One such strategy is to create academically homogeneous environments where students are grouped into classes based on their preconceived academic ability. The research team tests this common assertion through an experiment at The United States Military Academy at West Point. Students are placed in either ability- or randomly grouped sections of the academy's mandatory introduction to probability and statistics course, where their ability projections are based on mathematical modeling of a student's historical academic performance. A quantitative analysis of student performances across major graded events indicates that there is not a significant difference in student performance between ability- and randomly grouped sections. This is the first robust experiment of this nature at the undergraduate level and provides useful insight to educators and administrators alike.

C2  - &quot;Meredith v. Jefferson County/Parents Involved v. Seattle&quot; ruled that K-12 public-school districts could no longer use the race of an individual student for placement in schools, which resulted in districts adopting new &quot;race-neutral&quot; assignment plans. This qualitative research study on school assignment and school choice analyzes the narratives of parents in Louisville, Kentucky during the advent of a new school assignment plan based on balancing schools with a &quot;race-neutral&quot; and class-sensitive assignment strategy. Specifically, the study focuses on how middle-class parents resist and/or replicate their social position in navigating race, class, and geography in choosing schools for their children. By focusing on middle-class parents, this study explores how privileged decision-making can undo education policy aims.

C2  - Underprepared students at community colleges are often assigned to a sequence of developmental education (DE) courses that can substantially delay, or even halt, their progress to degree completion. In 2014, Florida took a drastic step forward when it implemented a comprehensive DE reform. Our findings show large, positive base effects of the reform for all students as well as heterogeneous effects by high school academic preparation. More specifically, students in the two lowest tracks of high school academic preparation--students for whom much of the reform was explicitly designed--experienced greater gains than did students in the upper two tracks. However, students in the upper tracks also experienced gains and students in the lowest track experienced the greatest gains of all. These findings suggest that when statewide DE reform was implemented in Florida, all students benefited, with the least prepared students experiencing the greatest gains.

However, some students may be self‐selecting to begin their mathematics sequence in a lower‐level calculus course than their prior achievement and aptitude would suggest is appropriate (i.e., undermatch).PurposeThis study examined (a) the relationship between engineering students' academic outcomes and first‐year calculus course taken, (b) the extent to which first‐year engineering students select calculus courses appropriate for their prior mathematics achievement and background, and (c) students' rationales for calculus course selection.Design/MethodThe study used a mixed‐methods approach consisting of quantitative t‐test, multiple regression, and classification decision tree model analyses of student records of (a) first‐year engineering students from 2009 to 2016 (n = 2689) at a highly selective public research university and (b) qualitative focus groups of 95 undergraduate engineering students in 2017–2018.ResultsStudents who begin their math sequence in Calculus I had lower graduating grade point averages, longer time‐to‐degree, and were less likely to major in popular engineering fields than those who started in Calculus II. Of first‐year undergraduates, 18.4% undermatched their choice of calculus course. Students' rationales for choosing a particular calculus course included (a) prior achievement, (b) recommendations from others, and (c) self‐confidence.ConclusionsResults suggest that undermatching the choice of first calculus course may lead to negative consequences for students' STEM pathways even at a highly selective engineering school. These results hold implications for practice, especially in terms of advising at the high school and college levels.

AB  -  Purpose: This article examines the relationship between educational and residential segregation in three school districts with differing approaches to student assignment. Racial and income segregation within school districts is often only examined at the school level, even as school patterns are often related to residential and attendance zone segregation depending on integration policies aimed at decoupling these relationships. Research Method/Approach: Using an innovative data set, the School Attendance Boundary Survey, along with Census and Common Core of Data data, this analysis examines racial and income segregation at the neighborhood, school zone, and school levels in three districts with varied student assignment policies to explore the relationship between districts’ diversity policies and school, attendance zone, and residential segregation. Findings: We find that, despite high residential segregation, educational segregation varies in these three districts. In the two districts that sought to increase diversity in their student assignment policies, educational segregation was lower than in the third district that did not consider diversity, despite similar levels of residential segregation. The findings suggest that district leaders’ use of diversity-focused student assignment policies may be one way to disrupt the link between residential and school segregation. Conclusions: Understanding the segregation of educational boundaries within school districts, and the relationship between school zone segregation and segregation at other geographic scales, offers insights into how district leaders could utilize student assignment policies to reduce racial and income segregation.

We do not know enough, however, about what contexts and features of EL education lead to these divergent effects. Because students are classified as ELs at all grade levels, and the structure and content of schooling change dramatically across grades, one important consideration is whether EL classification operates differently for students in different grade spans. This study draws on the knowledge of veteran EL educators in one large, urban school district to examine the affordances and potential hazards of being classified as EL in different grade spans. The paper asks first, how these educators interpret EL-classified students' academic and social experiences at different grade spans, and second, what features of schooling shape these heterogeneous experiences of EL classification. Analysis of in-depth interviews suggests that academic exclusion, insufficient resources, and tracking, among other schooling features, increasingly constrict opportunities for students classified as ELs in upper grade spans. Key transitions -- from early to mid-elementary, and from elementary to secondary -- also alter EL-classified students' experiences.

AB  -  Researchers are concerned that English language learners (ELL) may remain classified too long and, therefore, may not receive appropriate mainstream educational services. In this study, we investigate the effects of language classification on student outcomes in one California school district. Our ordinary least squares regression estimates demonstrate that students who become reclassified fluent English proficient (RFEP) in middle school have higher achievement scores and better behavioral outcomes. However, regression discontinuity models show that reclassification has no effects on students’ outcomes. The findings of this study suggest that selection bias accounts for the positive associations between RFEP and desirable student outcomes. ELL and RFEP students have unmeasured characteristics that highly correlate with their language classification, therefore, their educational outcomes differ.

AB  - AbstractMany public school diversity efforts rely on reassigning students from one school to another. While opponents of such efforts articulate concerns about the consequences of reassignments for students’ educational experiences, little evidence exists regarding these effects, particularly in contemporary policy contexts. Using an event study design, we leverage data from an innovative socioeconomic school desegregation plan to estimate the effects of reassignment on reassigned students’ achievement, attendance, and exposure to exclusionary discipline. Between 2000 and 2010, North Carolina's Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) reassigned approximately 25 percent of students with the goal of creating socioeconomically diverse schools. Although WCPSS's controlled school choice policy provided opportunities for reassigned students to opt out of their newly reassigned schools, our analysis indicates that reassigned students typically attended their newly reassigned schools. We find that reassignment modestly boosts reassigned students’ math achievement, reduces reassigned students’ rate of suspension, and has no offsetting negative consequences on other outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggest that the effects of reassignment do not meaningfully vary by student characteristics or school choice decisions. The results suggest that carefully designed school assignment policies can improve school diversity without imposing academic or disciplinary costs on reassigned students.

AB  - AbstractThis study investigated potential inequalities in a bilingual education program where secondary school students are streamed into two strands with different degrees of exposure to the target language based on their proficiency: high exposure (HE) and low exposure (LE). Drawing on classroom registers (Christie, 2005), appraisal theory (Martin & White, 2005), and sociocultural perspectives on classroom interaction (Gibbons, 2006; Lemke, 1989; Mortimer & Scott, 2003), researchers analysed interactional practices by teachers teaching the same content in both groups. Results show no major differences in distribution of classroom registers and teachers’ general pedagogical purposes across groups. Analysis of students’ language use across registers corroborates previous studies showing that translanguaging in content and language integrated learning is more common when the focus is on classroom management issues (e.g., Moore & Nikula, 2016). The most striking results relate to differences in use of pedagogical purposes and evaluative language. These differences entail more interactional engagement in higher order thinking skills by HE students and use of a wider variety of language resources in the second language (L2) to express these meanings, compared to LE students. This indicates that the division into strands in bilingual programs may lead to different perceptions of students’ academic capacities beyond L2 proficiency and reinforcement of social differences and inequality in bilingual programs.

Logistic regression models consider the role of demographic factors, course format, and student support structures on the likelihood of a student completing the developmental sequence and subsequently passing a credit-level mathematics course. Additional linear regression models examine the time required to complete developmental coursework.

Alternative course formats are also associated with increased likelihood of success for students, but some alternative formats delay a student's time line.

AB  - AbstractAppropriate placement into courses at postsecondary institutions is critical for the success of students in terms of retention and graduation rates. To reduce the number of students who are misplaced, using multiple measures in placing students is encouraged. However, in practice most postsecondary schools utilize only a few measures to determine course placement. One of the reasons is the lack of research on methodologies that can be used to develop and establish appropriate cutoff scores using multiple measures. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the classification tree model is a useful alternative approach to the multiple logistic regression model for placement into college courses. For comparison, this research examined the approaches' effectiveness and predictive accuracy for College Algebra. Data were obtained from two medium‐sized four year, midwestern institutions. Using two well‐known tree models, important measures and their cutoff scores for College Algebra were determined. The findings of this study showed that tree models were an effective alternative approach. Tree models also performed better than, or as well as, the multiple logistic regression model in predictive accuracy.

C2  - Differentiated instruction is a student-centered approach to instruction that considers the differing characteristics and aspects of the learner. With increasing diversity in higher education, differentiated instruction is one strategy that instructors may use to facilitate student success. However, there is limited empirical research examining the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in higher education. Using a quasi-experimental pretest posttest group design, the effects of differentiation of instruction, specifically differentiation of content and variable grouping, on student content knowledge were examined in an undergraduate course in a Communication Sciences and Disorders program. Students in the intervention group scored significantly higher on final course grades and one unit posttest following participation in the intervention. Overall, the intervention group scored significantly higher on the final course grade than the comparison group. Yet, there were no significant differences between the intervention and comparison group on the final posttest scores, on the student perception survey, nor the weekly posttest quiz scores, except in the area of pragmatics. Implications for pedagogical approaches in CSD and higher education are discussed.

AB  - AbstractBackgroundFunctional thinking is characterized as a specific way of thinking in relationships, dependencies, and changes. Hence, beyond mathematics, it is also crucial for other (STEM) disciplines as well as for everyday situations. In particular, dealing with different representations of functions and changing between them are core function-related competencies, which are correspondingly needed for the formation of appropriate concepts and flexible problem-solving in various situations. Therefore, this study investigated students’ (N = 856) competencies related to representational changes of elementary functions and, in particular, assessed which changes are especially easy or difficult for students. Moreover, possible school track and gender differences were investigated by performing DIF analyses within the framework of Rasch modeling. The data were gathered using a paper–pencil test administered after the students had completed the teaching unit on linear functions in their mathematics lessons.ResultsAltogether, students were found to have limited competencies related to representational changes of elementary functions. There was no clear pattern regarding the types of representational change that were difficult or easy for them. Moreover, girls performed better on purely mathematical tasks, whereas boys did better at a complex modeling and problem-solving task. Classes from the academic track produced better results in tasks with a situational context compared to their peers from non-academic tracks, who performed relatively strongly on purely mathematical tasks.ConclusionsThese findings imply that various representations and representational changes should be included in lessons on functions to support students in building a rich concept of function and flexible problem-solving skills, thus fulfilling curricular requirements and responding to didactical considerations. In particular, the teaching of functions should be more balanced by mixing tasks with and without a situational context and the corresponding representational changes. These findings should motivate teachers, in particular those teaching non-academic tracks, to give a more prominent role to situational contexts in their lessons on functions in order to foster their students’ learning and build a bridge between mathematics and real-world situations.

C2  - Background: Functional thinking is characterized as a specific way of thinking in relationships, dependencies, and changes. Hence, beyond mathematics, it is also crucial for other (STEM) disciplines as well as for everyday situations. In particular, dealing with different representations of functions and changing between them are core function-related competencies, which are correspondingly needed for the formation of appropriate concepts and flexible problem-solving in various situations. Therefore, this study investigated students' (N = 856) competencies related to representational changes of elementary functions and, in particular, assessed which changes are especially easy or difficult for students. Moreover, possible school track and gender differences were investigated by performing DIF analyses within the framework of Rasch modeling. The data were gathered using a paper-pencil test administered after the students had completed the teaching unit on linear functions in their mathematics lessons. Results: Altogether, students were found to have limited competencies related to representational changes of elementary functions. There was no clear pattern regarding the types of representational change that were difficult or easy for them. Moreover, girls performed better on purely mathematical tasks, whereas boys did better at a complex modeling and problem-solving task.

The legislation also required colleges to provide accelerated instruction strategies for students remaining in DE and offer enhanced advising and support services for all incoming students. Focusing on the differential policy impacts on exempt and nonexempt students, we used statewide administrative data to examine changes in first-year completion rates for gateway math and English courses before and after the reform. Overall, and for those deemed to be college-ready, nonexempt students benefited more from the reform; however, the opposite is true for students who were not college-ready, with exempt students benefiting more.

AB  - Although inclusion is the declared goal, the transition from a system based on special schools to an inclusive school system has only been progressing very slowly in individual countries. In an evolving school system, the existing special schools keep struggling to justify their existence. This study investigates the regional distribution effects based on official school data and shows the influence of a pull effect on special schools as a distance effect of special schools affecting the placement of students. For this purpose, official school statistics including all students at special and regular schools in the years 2010, 2015 and 2020 (N = 11 280 040) are evaluated in a spatiotemporal comparison using Educational Data Mining. In a hierarchical regression model on school placement in inclusive schools, the distance between primary and special schools has the highest influence (β = 0.48) on the inclusion rate (i.e., the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in regular schools in relation to all students with disabilities), along with the size (β = −0.14) and the density of special schools in a district (β = −0.12). The effects differ according to the population density of the region and are stronger in large cities. When the proportion of students with and without SEN in regular schools is considered (support rate), the density of special schools has the greatest impact on school placement (ß = 43.44). Self‐preservation of schools, traditional funding systems and regional differences between urban and rural areas are discussed as possible reasons.

AB  -  School choice is expanding, but the majority of students in countries like the United States still attend the school associated with their residential address. We study assignment policies and reassignments of students, where students apply to attend a magnet school or request to transfer to another school within the public school system. Policymakers and researchers have expressed concerns that these type of reassignment programs could increase racial and socioeconomic stratification and cause an imbalance of resources across schools. We provide evidence from the Wake County Public School System in North Carolina. Our focus is on changes in racial and socioeconomic stratification across schools relative to the existing degree of stratification that exists in the district through its assignment via schools’ attendance boundaries. The reassignment programs available in this district reduce stratification in terms of race, socioeconomic status, student need, and student ability. To place our results in context, we conduct several simulations to compare the observed changes in stratification to what changes are possible. The effects on stratification are similar to what would be expected if students move between schools without regard to school composition, and the effects are small relative to the largest increases or decreases in stratification that could be expected given the volume of reassignments observed in these data. Thus, the reassignment programs we study do not increase stratification in terms of race, socioeconomic status, or student need/ability, but they also do not reduce stratification to a particularly large degree. Our results speak to school choice programs that can be characterized as controlled choice programs in which the district places constraints on moves between schools.

C2  - School choice is expanding, but the majority of students in countries like the United States still attend the school associated with their residential address. We study assignment policies and reassignments of students, where students apply to attend a magnet school or request to transfer to another school within the public school system.

Few studies have followed children with ASD who received EIBI into schools. The purpose of this study was to investigate educational outcomes specific to instructional placement, standardized test proficiency, and special education eligibility under the ASD category for children who received EIBI. Medicaid records were utilized to create a cross-systems data set of 3- to 5-year-old children with ASD ( n = 667). Most students were placed in general education, and males and White students were more likely to receive special education services for ASD. Only half of the students participated in standardized testing and met proficiency standards. Implications for future research and advocacy for early intervention are discussed.

In national data, we predicted kindergarten ability group placement using linear and ordinal logistic regression with classroom fixed effects. In fall, test scores were the best predictors of group placement, but there was bias favoring girls, high-SES (socioeconomic status) children, and Asian Americans, who received higher placements than their scores alone would predict. Net of SES, there was no bias against placing black children in higher groups. By spring, one third of kindergartners moved groups, and high-SES children moved up more than their score gains alone would predict. Teacher-reported behaviors (e.g., attentiveness, approaches to learning) helped explain girls’ higher placements, but did little to explain the higher placements of Asian American and high-SES children.

AB  -  This article provides the first causal evidence of a system-wide corequisite reform in Tennessee, which mainstreams underprepared students into college-level courses with concurrent support. Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-regression-discontinuity designs, we find that, for those on the margin of college level, students placed into corequisite remediation were up to 18 percentage points more likely to pass gateway courses by Year 1, compared with peers placed into prerequisite remediation, and they were 10 percentage points more likely to pass subsequent math than peers directly placed into the college level. The positive effects in math gateway completion were largely driven by efforts to guide students to take coursework aligned with the requirements for their program. We do not find significant impacts on long-term outcomes.

AB  - This study explored the mathematics course placement process for incoming students in an all-boys Catholic high school. The sequential nature of mathematics significantly impacts students’ opportunity to learn; moreover, the mathematics course taken by a student during ninth grade can have far-reaching effects. Previous studies have found that ninth-grade students enrolled in Geometry, rather than Algebra 1, have a greater chance of completing advanced mathematics courses and experiencing increased mathematics success. Thus, adequately prepared students should be placed in Geometry whenever possible. To aid this effort, this study investigated whether a relationship exists between course placement criteria and future mathematics achievement. The study sample was comprised of students who graduated from the subject high school between 2015 and 2019 (N = 1067). The placement criteria examined were Acuity Algebra Proficiency Test results, High School Placement Test mathematics scores, and eighth-grade teacher recommendations. ACT mathematics scores were used as measures of success; binary logistic regression was utilized to determine strength of association between placement criteria and future mathematics achievement. Results indicate that Acuity test performance is strongly associated with future mathematics achievement, while combinations of placement criteria are more effective than individual course placement measures. Implications for further research are discussed.

By examining a case study of one large, urban school district adjusting to the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSS-M), we demonstrate how district leaders’ interactions, in combination with their organizational and institutional environments, led to an overhaul of the secondary mathematics course pathway, ending in detracked middle school mathematics. We find that district leaders’ deliberations of mathematics policy were constrained by organizational concerns around pedagogy, equity, logistics, and politics. In other words, the disruption created by the CCSS-M was limited by extant organizational priorities. This study has potential implications for theorizing disruptions and for better understanding equity-oriented mathematics policy and practice.

AB  -  Research has begun to identify the breadth and complexity of contextual variables that impact the opportunities, services, and supports students with complex support needs receive across different classroom placements. Indeed, as research has suggested, placement in and of itself may determine the schooling experiences of these students in ways that can enhance or constrain the outcomes of the educational process. This study examined an array of contextual variables in relation to four types of placement in which students with complex support needs might be placed for educational services by their Individualized Education Program teams. Placements were defined in terms of percent of the school day students had access to age-level general education classes, ranging between no access (separate school) to 80% or higher (“inclusive”). The investigation used surveys completed by a national sample of special and general educators and administrators. Completed surveys were obtained for 117 students with complex support needs across all four types of placement. The findings revealed potential relationships between a number of contextual variables and placement, suggesting that: (a) student opportunities and experiences vary systematically in relation to the amount of access they have to general education classrooms and (b) the application of the Least Restrictive Environment process, with its tacit endorsement of segregated settings and specialized programs, may in fact negatively impact the education of many of these students. Implications of these findings and future research needs are discussed.

C2  - DE programming in higher education should be designed to increase student success, and well-designed corequisite models have shown great potential as an accelerated option for completion of the first college-level course in math. With the support of a Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board grant, Tarleton State University, a member institution of the Texas A&amp;M University System, revamped its developmental education (DE) program to exceed requirements for the Texas Success Initiative by fully scaling up student enrollment in corequisite models to 100%. Along with a multi-pronged approach to help students satisfy any TSI liabilities, Tarleton's revamped DE program includes holistic advising practices that use multiple measures to inform placement decisions, a robust expansion of corequisite models, refinement of assessment protocols, inclusion of peer mentoring services, and two intervention options to address academic underpreparedness and issues with self-efficacy in math. Findings from the first year of implementation were favorable and demonstrated a significant increase in course completion when compared to the previous year. Limitations of this study and areas for future research were also discussed.

Previous research has found that the opportunities for, and importance of, social contacts for students with complex support needs vary by educational placement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a national sample of 92 elementary-aged students with complex support needs to determine whether placement predicts the number and importance of social contacts. We used multilevel regression analysis to measure the extent to which placement predicts the number of social contacts and teachers’ ratings of importance. Students in inclusive placements had almost 50% more social contacts than students in a segregated school. Furthermore, teachers’ perceptions of the social significance of the contacts experienced by students with complex support needs were notably higher in inclusive settings. Given these findings, we suggest implications for practice and future research.

C2  - High school calculus has become indispensable for students seeking a college degree in a STEM field. However, in the present study, we argue that the mathematics opportunities that students seize (when afforded) in middle grades are the key to earning calculus credit in high school. To take calculus in high school, students usually need to take advanced mathematics in middle school to take the prerequisite courses. We analyzed the probability of earning credit in calculus based on a sample of (n = 17,765) students and their eighth-grade mathematics courses. Using descriptive statistics and odds ratio effect sizes we found that taking advanced (i.e., algebra in eighth grade) mathematics courses greatly increased a student's chances of earning calculus credit in high school. However, the results indicated that taking double advanced (i.e., geometry in eighth grade) only statistically significantly improved the odds of Asian students earning calculus credit in high school. While participating in double advanced mathematics statistically significantly lowered the odds of earning calculus credit compared to the advanced track for Black and Latinx students. These findings have major implications for providing equitable math instruction for all students, especially in light of the many math students who are tracked into courses with limited ways to earn the calculus credit necessary for STEM-related college and career success.

C2  - Educators, researchers, and policy makers concerned about college under-enrollment among underserved groups of students have traditionally focused reform efforts at the high school level. Over the last several decades, however, there has been a growing interest in improving college readiness beginning at the elementary level. Recently, the well-known Achievement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program launched a college readiness program for elementary students (AE). Drawing on in-depth qualitative case study data on six AE schools from four states (Arizona, California, Washington, and Florida) in the U.S., we examine the profound affect that program coherence can have on supporting student learning and socializing elementary students into a college going culture. Over fifty interviews with teachers and school principals reveal the impact of structural and cultural coherence, along with the influence of educators' actions when they cohere around a focused common goal of supporting students on an academically oriented path. At the same time, this study shows that when students were faced with the absence of reform coherence at the district level, they were unable to access the academic support needed to sustain this trajectory. This study has important implications for reform policy and practice at the school and district level.

C2  - Following national trends in both mathematics placement and developmental mathematics coursework progression, this study investigates alternative placement options that remove a developmental mathematics barrier for as many students as possible by providing alternative placement pathways. By allowing students to be placed directly into the subsequent required mathematics course based on their major and chosen course of study, the intended outcomes were to attain similar pass rates in students' first mathematics class as the one they would have been enrolled in, while simultaneously promoting equivalent pass rates in the up-placed class and decreasing the length of time before students enrolled in their first gateway mathematics course. Results show that success of students in up-placed and subsequent courses varied based on the content and context of the up-placed course and ultimate degree requirement of students. As with remediation itself, it should come as no surprise that a one-size-fits-all approach to alternative pathways through university-level mathematics requirements does not exist.

AB  - Background and Context: Racialized disparities in curricular tracking have long been ascribed to narrow tests that create a hierarchy of perceived ability. Consequently, teachers are urged to reject deficit views of ability and embrace more expansive techniques to reveal and respond to the real-life needs of students, especially those from minoritized groups. Paradoxically, these tools, upheld as equity strategies today, had prior careers racializing populations along a hierarchy of perceived needs. That hierarchy, which gave a humanitarian basis for curricular tracking, continues to produce racializing effects today. Purpose: This article rethinks how teachers are taught to distinguish the real-life needs of students from marginalized communities. As a history of the present, it examines how demographic distinctions in health-related needs emerged historically and became tied to lower track science and mathematics instruction. We ask: To what extent do current strategies persist in dividing populations and prescribing distinct pedagogies? Have the normalizing impulses of past tools been removed or rearticulated in recent reforms that promote educational and health equity? Research Design: We first analyzed articles reviewed as exemplary of culturally responsive science and mathematics education to identify techniques recommended to uncover students’ real-life needs. Next, we compared these techniques with similar tools promoted in early 20th-century U.S. science and mathematics education journals, when these fields began distinguishing types of students and matching them with distinct tiers of instruction. Conclusions: Despite key shifts over the century (e.g., from treating inherent pathologies to redressing inequities), similar tools operate as humanitarian techniques today. That is, they classify populations as having “immediate needs” for intervention in daily life that preempt “future needs” for academic preparation. The resulting hierarchy of perceived needs orders students and subject matter from applied relevance to abstract rigor. This yields four dangers: (1) positing target students and families as not-yet-capable of self-direction, (2) prioritizing for target groups an applied and often lower prestige curriculum with consequences for their academic trajectories, (3) depoliticizing systemic inequities as problems of attitude adjustment, and (4) depoliticizing mainstream science and mathematics education by isolating sociopolitical concerns as compensatory interventions. We argue that school science and mathematics are not unique in these respects but epitomize risks present whenever social scientific tools offer an ostensibly neutral basis for seeing and sorting difference.

The hierarchical regression results showed that minority students’ grade-repetition experience mattered substantially. But the differences between schools in poverty concentration, use of between-class and within-class tracking, class size, plus school discipline all contributed to the racial achievement gaps.

C2  - Our study evaluated the effectiveness of a new tracking policy called self-selection (SS). The purpose of SS was to increase the representation of students of color in advanced mathematics courses at an urban midwestern middle school. We conducted a multinomial logistic regression to determine the effect of the SS on enrollment trends among 2,627 students. The results of our analysis indicate that Black and Latinx students were less likely to enroll in advanced mathematics courses after the implementation of self-selection. Based on our findings, SS did not statistically significantly increase the ethnic representation of historically underserved students of color in advanced middle school mathematics courses. Implications and considerations for future research on SS are discussed.

AB  -  There is growing evidence that school starting age impacts children's likelihood of receiving special education services, but less is known about variations in this effect. Using a regression discontinuity design, I found that the youngest students in a kindergarten cohort are 40% more likely ( p < .001) to be placed in special education than are the oldest students, and that this effect persists through eighth grade. I found little evidence of heterogeneity by gender, race, or socioeconomic status, but some suggestive evidence that the effect is particularly great for White boys in early grades and for Black girls in the later elementary grades. I also found exploratory evidence that this effect is largest in schools with kindergarten cohorts that vary widely in age. These findings add new evidence to support policies to reduce age-induced bias in early special education placements, particularly those that address variation in this effect across students and schools.

C2  - Prior research on school tracking has indicated that racialized classed ethnic students are channeled and separated into cohorts based on academic ability. Few studies have indicated the ways in which early socialization of teachers is imparted through pedagogical practices. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research when it comes to understanding how ideological tracking is reproduced in the context of the classroom. Findings suggest that teacher ideologies, situated within their early socialization, are manifested in through perspectives of difference. This article makes a case for teacher credential training preparation programs to incorporate self-reflexive methodologies to limit reproduction of unconscious teaching/learning in the instruction of students.

Descriptive results support an increased liability perspective, with the negative relationship between a learning disability and math course placement larger for adolescents more privileged in terms of their race and/or SES. Adjusted results suggest that the lower math course placements of youth with learning disabilities are due to cumulative disadvantage rather than disability-related inequities in the transition to high school for youth of diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition to demonstrating the importance of intersectional perspectives, this study provides a roadmap for future studies by introducing the new perspective of increased liability to be used in conjunction with the widely employed perspective of multiple marginalization.

First, we compare commute times by foot, public transit, school bus, and car. We show that providing school bus service reduces commute times and improves access for families without cars, but access to a car fundamentally shapes families’ options. Second, we explore the relationship between neighborhood-level measures of vehicle access and families’ school requests and placements. Car access is strongly associated with school requests and placements even after accounting for neighborhood characteristics. We consider car access as a pathway by which wealth disparities produce educational disparities in settings that emphasize school choice.

AB  -  Objective: Extensive reform has been implemented in community colleges across the nation to help expedite the attainment of students’ academic goals of degree completion and transfer to 4-year institutions. Reform at the institution in this study resulted in replacement of the college writing placement exam and the precollegiate course sequence with an online assessment questionnaire by which students were provided with an automated recommendation based on their high school records to enroll into one of two versions of the transfer-level composition course, either with or without a support course. Examined are: (1) whether students who need the most writing support are effectively positioning themselves to receive it; and (2) whether the new placement policy improves students’ chances for college success while examining its impact on specific student subgroups. Method: An analytic writing assessment and survey were administered to students. Compared are students’ scores on the assessment, their self-reported high-school GPA, and their final course grades. Results: Findings show: (1) no significant differences in academic writing proficiency between students enrolled in the two course types; (2) students mostly followed the college’s recommendation for enrollment based on their high school GPA, which is found to be weakly related to their measured levels of writing proficiency; and (3) generally high course pass rates of students at all levels of proficiency. Contribution: This study generates data that can help inform policy and practice in community colleges and clarify ways to best support students in composition toward achieving their academic goals of degree attainment and transfer.

AB  -  This meta-analysis examines the effects of sorting secondary students into different tracks (“between-school” tracking) or classrooms (“within-school” tracking) on the efficiency and inequality levels of an educational system. Efficiency is related to the overall learning achievement of students, whereas inequality can refer to “inequality of achievement” (i.e., the dispersion of outcomes) or “inequality of opportunity” (i.e., the strength of the influence of family background on student achievement). The selected publications are 53 analyses performed in the period from 2000 to 2021, yielding 213 estimates on efficiency and 230 estimates on inequality. The results show that the mean effect size (Hedge’s G) of tracking on efficiency is not statistically significant (G = −.063), whereas it is significantly positive (G = .117) on inequality. We further set out to explain variation in effect sizes by (a) policy characteristics, (b) the operationalization of main variables, (c) the research design, (d) the set of control variables included in the statistical analyses, and (e) the quality of the study, year of publication, and publication status (peer reviewed or not peer reviewed).

Efficiency is related to the overall learning achievement of students, whereas inequality can refer to &quot;inequality of achievement&quot; (i.e., the dispersion of outcomes) or &quot;inequality of opportunity&quot; (i.e., the strength of the influence of family background on student achievement). The selected publications are 53 analyses performed in the period from 2000 to 2021, yielding 213 estimates on efficiency and 230 estimates on inequality. The results show that the mean effect size (Hedge's G) of tracking on efficiency is not statistically significant (G = -0.063), whereas it is significantly positive (G = 0.117) on inequality. We further set out to explain variation in effect sizes by (a) policy characteristics, (b) the operationalization of main variables, (c) the research design, (d) the set of control variables included in the statistical analyses, and (e) the quality of the study, year of publication, and publication status (peer reviewed or not peer reviewed).

C2  - We investigated how high school mathematics course placement contributes to inequalities in college preparation for students categorized as &quot;English Learners&quot; (ELs), especially &quot;long-term&quot; English Learners (LTELs). We devised a base-2 enumeration approach that allowed us to process complex transcript data from one school district and enumerate the thousands of possible trajectories (combinations) of mathematics courses taken by students during high school. We observed significant disparities in college preparation across students by English proficiency designation. In comparison to English Only (EO) students, LTELs were funneled into fewer trajectories that predominantly included lower level mathematics courses. We found that enrollment into remedial mathematics courses in Grade 9 appears to restrict access to advanced courses, with grave consequences for Grade 12 college preparation.

C2  - The number of students assigned to special education has increased in the past decades, in spite of efforts for more inclusion. For students with mild learning or behavioral difficulties, special education assignment might be prevented if appropriate support is provided in general education. In this study, research on programs that could reduce the number of students assigned to special education is reviewed systematically. The review focuses on students in elementary schools. In total, 12 experimental or quasi-experimental studies of nine programs were reviewed. Programs were categorized based on what they were designed to improve: academic achievement, behavior, or both, and the multi-tiered Response to Intervention (RTI) framework was used to describe the intensity of the programs. It was found that several programs did reduce the number of students assigned to special education, while others did not or yielded mixed results. Three common elements of programs deemed effective were identified: an emphasis on tutoring, professional development and parental involvement. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

C2  - Psychoeducational assessment has been used as a tool to sort children into academic tracks based on children's presumed capabilities. Historically, such tracking was based on measures that sought to legitimize racist assumptions about the capabilities of children of color. Despite legal mandates and changes to practice intended to correct these injustices, children of color continue to be disproportionately sorted into less rigorous academic tracks largely based on assessment results. This article draws from the collaborative/therapeutic assessment model to propose how these techniques can increase equity and fairness in school-based assessments through shared power in the assessment relationship. We assert that a collaborative/therapeutic approach can contribute to children's and families' positive experience of assessment, and we encourage further research on these techniques to determine how they may contribute to more equitable school outcomes. We conclude with a rationale for how these techniques advance the goals of school psychology.

AB  - Background: For the last century, the dominant practice in U.S. high schools has involved sorting students by perceived ability level, yet 40 years of research has yielded consistent evidence that these practices harm the learning of students placed in lower-level classes; evidence is inconsistent about benefits for students in classes designated as higher-level, depending often on the actual pedagogy involved. Sufficient evidence exists to encourage schools to take on the challenge of implementing effective differentiated pedagogy within heterogeneous classrooms. Ideally, such pedagogy would avoid the well-established negative effects of separate-class ability grouping while preserving opportunities for all students to access stimulating and challenging learning opportunities that are both suited to their present readiness level and geared toward pushing them to advance to higher levels of academic capability. Focus of Study: Despite all that is known about the harms of tracking, most studies have focused on the contrast between classes that are tracked by ability level vs. heterogeneously grouped classes. There has been little research on the opportunity to embed an “honors” option within a heterogeneously grouped class. In theory, embedded honors may prove an antidote to some of the challenges presented by separated ability-grouped classes while avoiding the pitfalls of non-differentiated heterogeneous environments. This study examined one school’s change in student placement policy to test whether within-class leveling (within heterogeneously grouped classes) correlated with an increase in the participation of students, particularly from marginalized groups, signing up for “honors” level learning opportunities, as well as with an increase in learning and performance among any populations of students. The study also attempted to examine how students experienced learning in within-class leveling in heterogeneously grouped classes vs. separately grouped, leveled courses, in terms of the various areas identified in the literature. Research Design: This is a multi-methods study combining analysis of existing quantitative and qualitative data, as well as analysis of additional follow-up surveys and qualitative interviews. This case study examines one suburban Massachusetts high school’s experiment with converting seven separated “ability-leveled” courses in English, history, science, and math into heterogeneously grouped courses, in which students could elect whether or not to take the class for “honors” credit while still learning alongside the full spectrum of their peers. The authors examine data collected by the district ( n = 6,995 student data points), as well as from surveys and interviews ( n = 709) to analyze the resulting changes to enrollment and achievement, in the context of existing theory and research around grouping practices. Conclusions: Statistically significant correlational results included: (1) increased participation in Honors1 coursework, particularly among students from traditionally marginalized groups; (2) lower barriers to enrollment in Honors classes among students who had previously enrolled in non-Honors classes; and (3) statistically significant increased academic performance for all students enrolled in Honors options, including those who had previously enrolled in non-Honors. In addition, students reported (4) decreased stigma for those enrolled in the non-Honors option, (5) more diverse classrooms, and (6) perception of greater academic challenge among students who selected non-Honors within heterogeneously grouped classes, but diminished challenge among students who selected Honors. Cautions include that this experiment was conducted during the pandemic-induced remote learning period of 2020–21; thus, many other factors may influence these results. Teachers in the study also appear to have been inconsistent in their use of effective pedagogy for differentiating instruction. Authors offer discussion of what schools elsewhere might be able to learn about improving leveling and equity efforts from this case study.

AB  -  Self-placement in math is becoming increasingly popular in community colleges in the U.S., where students will decide for themselves whether to enroll in non-credit developmental (or remedial) math courses. To fully understand the factors associated with students’ math enrollment choices and the long-term effects of initial math enrollment choices, we use data from all first-time-in-college students in the Florida College System to conduct a multinomial logistic regression analysis and an inverse-probability regression adjustment analysis. We find that most students chose to directly enroll in college-level math, with significant differences by gender and high school math preparation. First-year math enrollment choices were significantly associated with likelihood of passing college-level math and the number of college credits by the third year.

C2  - This qualitative study examined the mathematics self-confidence of eight junior high school students who were moved to an above-grade-level mathematics class through a nontraditional process. Teachers were concerned about how this transition may impact students' beliefs about their abilities to succeed in mathematics. Data were collected through interviews that included solving challenging mathematical tasks as a means to consider how students expressed their self-confidence in mathematics in general. Using a socio-constructivist lens with a focus on mediation, findings included themes about tensions given students' initial placement, changes in the role of self-confidence as a mediator, feelings of belonging as having multiple mediator roles, workarounds as mediators, and self-regulation strategies as internalized mediators that students brought with them to their transition. These findings point to solutions and supports for students who enroll in above-grade-level courses to view themselves as successful.

C2  - How does reassigning students to create schools that are more socioeconomically and academically diverse affect the distribution of educational opportunity? What are the impacts on students who switch schools as a result of these policies? And how do changes in school assignments affect the students who don't switch schools, but who experience changes in their classmates' characteristics? In this article, the authors report the results from two distinct studies of North Carolina's Wake County Public School System, which has a long history of using student assignment policies to weaken the school-neighborhood links that exacerbate school segregation. Their research teams, one based at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and the other originating at the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University, have worked closely with the district to better understand how student assignment policies affect academic and behavioral outcomes and how changing the demographic characteristics of a student's peers affects learning. They find that, on the whole, school reassignment has somewhat muted effects. In contrast to the sharp criticism and heated controversy that integration programs often inspire, switching schools does not harm students who are reassigned. In fact, reassigned students perform modestly better on statewide tests and are less likely to be suspended. They do find some negative effects for students who switch to schools where achievement and income levels are lower, but these effects are offset by positive impacts for students when school reassignments mean they learn alongside higher-performing and wealthier peers. However, these impacts are small, because, in most cases, students' new schools are largely similar to the schools they left behind. Put another way, the impacts of school integration rely more on the destination than the departure.

Our regression discontinuity (RD) estimates at the English proficiency margin consistently differ substantively from positive associations generated through regression analyses. RD evidence indicates that EL status had no effect on SPED placement at the English proficiency threshold. Grade-by-grade and subgroup RD analyses at this margin suggest that ELs were modestly underidentified for SPED during Grade 5 and that ELs whose primary language was Spanish were underidentified for SPED.

C2  - Universal screening for social, emotional, and behavioral risk is an important method for identifying students in need of additional or targeted support (Eklund and Dowdy in School Mental Health 6:40-49, 2014). Research is needed to explore how potential bias may be implicated in universal screening. We investigated student demographics as predictors of being placed at risk via a teacher-report measure: the Social, Academic, and Emotional Behavior Risk Screener as reported by Kilgus et al. (in: Theodore J. Christ et al. (eds) Social, academic, and emotional behavior risk screener (SAEBRS), 2014). Results indicated student demographics, including sex, special education status, free/reduced price lunch status, and identification as a student of color, were statistically significant predictors across multiple SAEBRS risk placements. The predictive power of student demographics was meaningful when evaluated independently (i.e., when each characteristic was considered separately with each risk placement) as well as when evaluated relatively or dependently (i.e., when all characteristics were taken together as a set to predict each risk placement). We discuss findings in the context of implications for implementation of universal behavioral screening amidst potential bias and serving students with identified levels of social, emotional, and behavioral risk.

C2  - Researchers in the field of special education has voiced concerns about the disproportionality of diverse students identified for special education services for decades. However, most of the recent research has focused on showing this issue using quantitative data. The voices beyond the numbers are imperative in better understanding this decades long phenomenon. Unfortunately, these voices are rarely present within the context of disproportionality in special education. The present study reports a systematic review of qualitative articles to highlight findings in the literature to contextualize current quantitative data and provide a more representative picture of the phenomenon in the U.S. Results show the over and underrepresentation of students of color in special education according to the voices of educators, family members, and others supporting these students.

C2  - Purpose: This study investigates how the practice of dividing students and coursework into leveled categories persists in science education despite decades of efforts aimed at reducing inequities. This study makes underlying logics visible through an empirical analysis of how science educators attempt to reconcile an egalitarian vision of science for all students with divisive practices of grouping students and coursework into levels. Research Methods/Approach: This case study uses ethnographic methods during a 2-year period where researchers were embedded alongside teachers to investigate how a high school science department recreated hidden systems of leveled science coursework within a detracked institutional context. Data analysis draws on scholarship from Science and Technology Studies as well as organizational theory to examine how leveled categories are made through instructional logics built into teachers' work practice. Findings: Findings describe how certain students and science courses are categorized as &quot;not honors material&quot; through recursive discourses and practices that sort, divide, delay, and ultimately deny educational opportunities. Science teachers' instructional decision making was governed by two instructional logics: a mismatch logic and a not-yet-ready logic. These logics made it possible to enact stratification practices denying education opportunities to students seen as mismatched or unready for certain science coursework even as overt tracks were eliminated. Implications: Findings raise implications for current science education reform efforts aiming for greater equity, suggesting that categorization of science courses and students is entrenched in teachers' work practice and will need direct attention to dismantle.

C2  - Why are most African American students in lower-track classes in racially diverse schools? How does the nexus of home, school, and community impact African Americans' academic placement in a racially and economically diverse school district? This research used ethnographic methods to explore 38 African American middle school students' perceptions and experiences of academic placement in a racially diverse middle school and a segregated and disinvested African American neighborhood. This research introduces the term Plessy's Tracks to acknowledge the sustained racial caste system that manifests through lower-track classes and devalued homes and communities. Findings suggest students face multiple challenges and systemic inequalities when self-selecting classes. Also, racially segregated homes and communities have shaped racialized tracking while producing Black placemaking in homes, classrooms, and communities.

AB  - AbstractResearch has proven that when students are tracked and experience some form of exclusionary discipline, their risk of dropping out of school increases significantly. These effects are compounded for students from low socioeconomic households and students of color. However, there exists a gap in the literature concerning how tracking in specific subjects (mathematics) can influence disciplinary outcomes for students. This study uses the theoretical framework of intersectionality to examine the influence of mathematics tracking while taking into consideration students' identity (socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender), on their likelihood of receiving an in‐school suspension (ISS). To examine the effects, we asked the research question: Does tracking in mathematics influence the likelihood of students receiving an ISS in the eleventh grade based on their race/ethnicity, gender, and SES identity? Using both logistic regressions with a reference group and single group, we found that enrollment in a non‐advanced course in the eleventh grade for Asian boys and girls, Latinx girls, multiracial boys and girls, and White boys and girls increased ISS odds more than their racial and SES identity. This study concludes with recommendations for educators seeking to eliminate tracking in secondary schools.

AB  - While parents of students with disabilities (SWD) select schools according to various factors, schools also choose students through different sorting mechanisms. Thus, parents of SWD may need to employ different strategies to enroll their child in their preferred school. We employed an intersectional approach for studying school choice, integrating ethnographic interviews and descriptive GIS to answer the following questions: (a) What strategies do parents of SWD utilize to secure placement in the school of their choice? and (b) How is the engagement with such strategies shaped by their social and geographical locations? We found that parents engaged in five strategies: Accepting an IEP Team’s school recommendations, securing placement through a sibling, testing into selective enrollments, changing IEP provisions, and engaging in due process. Moreover, these strategies were afforded and constrained by their intersecting social positions (i.e., race, class, and disability), their geographical locations, and the developmental school stage of their child (i.e., transitioning to kindergarten or high school).

C2  - The number of undergraduates placing into developmental or &quot;remedial&quot; coursework continues to increase. This rise is concerning because developmental or &quot;remedial&quot; coursework creates barriers for many students. This mixed method study examines a holistic approach to placement. After one-on-one interviews with mathematics faculty, students (N = 8) within two points of passing our mathematics placement test (MPT) were given the opportunity to enroll in college-level coursework (Business Calculus) instead of the developmental coursework (Algebra). There were no significant differences in final exam and course grades between these students and those who initially placed into the course. Additionally, the qualitative data revealed many common themes and future ideas for intervention.

AB  -  Separate school placements persist for students with extensive support needs (ESN) despite longstanding federal mandates for all students with disabilities to be educated in the least restrictive environment. This study extends research on separate school placement for students with ESN to explore the potential impact of locale and charter school policy by determining (1) the percentage of separate schools in states across locales, (2) whether there is a relationship between the percentages of separate schools in each locale and separate school placement rates, and (3) how the number and location of separate special education charter schools change by state over time. Results showed varying proportions of separate schools among each locale in states with different placement rates, a significant moderate difference between the percentage of separate schools in suburban locales and overall separate school placement rate, and few separate special education charter schools. Implications for research and practice are highlighted.

AB  -  The relationship between academic tracking and exclusionary discipline actions has only been studied in a limited number of empirical studies. By placing students at the lower strata, schools deprive them of the educational opportunities, widening the educational opportunity gap in a process we define as “opportunity stratification.” Using a quantitative analysis of data from the Educational Longitudinal Study, we found students in low-track, non-college preparatory courses had higher odds of experiencing both in-school and out-of-school suspensions when compared to students in the high-track, college preparatory courses. Our findings support the intersecting role of exclusionary discipline and tracking in opportunity stratification.
