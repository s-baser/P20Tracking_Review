    "Due to the large number of articles, we sought a method to import the database into Endnote in bulk and collect PDFs. Our research indicated that DOIs are the most reliable way to capture this information. However, since ERIC has not retroactively updated the URL field to include DOIs added by publishers after publication, we aimed to find a way to capture more DOIs. We developed several Excel formulas (e.g., DOI Formula and URL Found) to identify URLs with DOIs and standardize them (Excel file: Phase 2D - Search 1 Checks). With this information, we wrote a Python script to import the Phase 2D - Abstract Screening file, normalize the titles (to lowercase), and use exact and fuzzy matching to find reference information (title, DOI, URL, citation count) from the CrossRef API using the Habanero client.\n",

    "We created a CSV version of the CrossRef file and used an XLOOKUP function to join the information with Phase 2d - Abstract Screening. Using the collected data, we developed a \"Continued URL\" column and a \"DOI_FORMULA_POST2\" column to capture the DOI URLs across both the ERIC and CrossRef columns, creating the relevant categories in the table. For the 91 articles without a URL, we recorded them in the \"Missing URLs\" column. Several articles had incorrect titles from ERIC. Approximately 15 articles had full texts available on ERIC.ED.GOV, while others had direct PDFs from journals, and a large portion had a DOI, JSTOR stable link, or PMID. Articles that could not be located were requested as PDFs through the UGA interlibrary loan program.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook automates the process of downloading PDFs using DOIs from a dataset by querying various Sci-Hub mirrors. It organizes the downloaded files into decade-specific folders with appropriate naming conventions.\n",
    "Steps in the Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Prepare the Environment:</b>\n",
    "<ul> <li>Define the base folder location for storing PDFs.</li> <li>Set up a rotating list of user-agent strings to mimic different browsers for better access.</li> </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Define Helper Functions:</b>\n",
    "<ul> <li><code>sanitize_filename()</code>: Removes invalid characters from filenames.</li> <li><code>shorten_title()</code>: Shortens the title by concatenating and capitalizing a few words.</li> <li><code>create_filename()</code>: Constructs the filename based on author, year, and title.</li> <li><code>get_decade_folder()</code>: Determines the correct decade folder for organizing PDFs.</li> <li>Custom functions for extracting PDF links from HTML content for different Sci-Hub mirrors.</li> </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Main PDF Download Function:</b>\n",
    "<ul> <li><code>download_pdf()</code>: Downloads the PDF based on the DOI and saves it to the appropriate decade folder.</li> <li>Handles retries and rotates through different user-agents to avoid request blocks.</li> <li>Attempts multiple Sci-Hub mirrors until a successful download is completed or retries are exhausted.</li> </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Execution Loop:</b>\n",
    "<ul> <li>Iterates through the dataset and calls <code>download_pdf()</code> for each entry.</li> </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Output</b>:\n",
    "<ul> <li><b>PDF Files:</b> The notebook saves PDFs in decade-specific subfolders within the base folder. The filenames follow the format: <ul> <li>Single author: <code>rsch_YEAR_LastName_ShortTitle.pdf</code></li> <li>Two authors: <code>rsch_YEAR_LastName1.LastName2_ShortTitle.pdf</code></li> <li>Three or more authors: <code>rsch_YEAR_LastName et al_ShortTitle.pdf</code></li> </ul> </li> <li><b>Logs:</b> The notebook prints status updates and error messages to indicate progress and any issues encountered during the download process.</li> </ul>\n",
